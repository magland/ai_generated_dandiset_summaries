In this study, we investigated the representation of odor-evoked activity within the mouse olfactory bulb (OB) using mesoscale two-photon calcium imaging. The aim was to explore how these representations facilitate odor discrimination, challenging existing theories that propose a sparse coding mechanism. Instead, we hypothesized that during odor presentation, a denser representation might be present, providing more robustness and reliability in the encoding of odor information. By employing machine learning models, we analyzed the recorded population-level responses to odors, proposing that while sparse coding may be largely adequate for olfaction, the inclusion of redundant information could enhance the resilience of odor coding across various conditions.

The experiments involved head-fixed mice positioned on a running wheel, with odors presented to them while imaging the glomerular activity on the olfactory bulbs' dorsal surfaces through a meso-scale two-photon microscope. The gathered data offered insights into the neuronal responses during different phases of odor presentation and enabled assessments of how the OB's activity correlates with odorant concentration and identity. Our findings suggest a comprehensive understanding of early odor processing, providing crucial updates to the current models of olfactory processing.

The available NWB files offer a comprehensive dataset, comprising data on respiration rate, treadmill position, and detailed two-photon imaging data across different fields of view. These include ImagingPlane, OpticalChannel, Device details, and continuous image captures during various experiment phases. Each file encompasses extensive image data like average images, correlation images, fluorescence traces, and plane segmentation data. The dataset spans data points such as odorant concentration, trial intervals, as well as behavioral and optophysiological processes. This rich data collection allows for a deep exploration of the OB's responses to diverse odor stimuli.
