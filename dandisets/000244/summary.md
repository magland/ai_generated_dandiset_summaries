# Experiment Summary

This dataset presents mesoscale calcium imaging data obtained from the isocortex of mice using one-photon dual wavelength imaging techniques. The study includes data from both awake and anesthetized subjects, focusing on cells expressing genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs). Specifically, it investigates calcium dynamics in excitatory neurons and three different types of inhibitory interneurons: parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SOM), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) expressing cells.

The purpose of these experiments is likely to understand the spatial and temporal patterns of neuronal activity across different cell types under varied physiological conditions. By examining the activity of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons across a broad cortical area, the dataset provides a comprehensive view of the neural dynamics underlying different brain states and cell types.

# NWB File Contents

The NWB files in this dataset contain detailed calcium imaging data across different wavelengths (cyan and ultraviolet) captured by a Zeiss AxioZoom v.16 microscope with a PlanNeoFluar Z 1x/0.25 objective. The imaging data is categorized by different neuron types and states (awake vs. anesthetized). Each file includes several metadata elements, such as the session identifier, experiment description, institution, and timestamps. Data are organized under acquisition groups indicating the specific imaging runs and wavelengths, with corresponding information about the imaging planes and optical channels.
