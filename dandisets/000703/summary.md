## Abstract

This study investigates the behavioral responses of Danio rerio, commonly known as zebrafish, to a constant temperature environment of 28°C under controlled light conditions. Conducted at THE Ohio State University, the experiment focuses on six-day post-fertilization (6dpf) zebrafish to better understand their locomotor responses and preference behaviors in a thermal gradient setting. A specialized gradient behavior chamber was employed to maintain uniform temperature conditions, and zebrafish movements were recorded with a high frame rate of 100 Hz to ensure precise data on swim patterns and heading directions.

The experimental setup aims to elucidate the effects of a consistent thermal environment on spatial navigation and preference among juvenile zebrafish. By analyzing their movement within left and right lanes of the gradient chamber, insights can be gained into the innate and learned behaviors exhibited by the zebrafish regarding thermal preference. Such studies contribute to a broader understanding of zebrafish as a model organism in neurobehavioral research, shedding light on fundamental behavioral processes that are conserved across species.

## NWB File Data Description

The NWB files contain comprehensive experimental data encompassing spatial and behavioral aspects of the zebrafish within the gradient chamber. Key datasets include fish heading directions captured as absolute values in radians through the SpatialSeries, the precise position coordinates of zebrafish in mm within the chamber, and continuous behavioral temperature recordings mapped to the fish’s location. These datasets cover both the left and right lanes of the gradient chamber, providing a detailed account of the navigational and positional behaviors of the fish.

Moreover, scratch data provide auxiliary information such as the experimental metadata and fish type identifiers. The raw metadata include session descriptions, timestamps, and specific temperature conditions across chamber sections. Notably, datasets like front and back temperatures enable the analysis of temperature profiles and their impact on zebrafish behavior within a controlled uniform temperature gradient.
