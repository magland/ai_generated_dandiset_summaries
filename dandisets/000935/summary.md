### Experiment Summary

This dataset captures in vivo extracellular electrophysiology and 1-photon bioluminescent imaging data to test a novel bioluminescent-optogenetic synaptic element. The experiment investigated six PV-Cre mice under isoflurane anesthesia divided into two groups: Opsin(+) and Opsin(-), each containing three animals. Each session began with a baseline recording of approximately three minutes, followed by the infusion of bioluminescent luciferin Coelenterazine into a saline well over an open craniotomy exposing the barrel cortex. The primary objective was to selectively control synaptically-connected circuit elements using bioluminescence and evaluate the physiological responses through electrophysiological and imaging approaches.

The study aims to refine optogenetic technologies, leveraging bioluminescence to potentially improve spatial and temporal precision in manipulating neural circuits. By infusing the luciferin substrate and recording the resultant bioluminescent activity and electrophysiological data, the researchers aimed to elucidate the functional dynamics and connectivity within the cortical circuits. This innovative approach provides valuable insights into the applications of bioluminescence in neuroscience research.

### Description of NWB Files

**Type 1 NWB Files:**
These files contain extensive metadata and experimental data including:
- 1-photon bioluminescent imaging data recorded at 1 Hz, capturing the output from the barrel cortex.
- Extracellular electrophysiology data acquired at 20 kHz and subsequently downsampled to 10 kHz.
- A comprehensive description of devices used, including an ixon 888 Ultra EMCCD camera and Intan 32-Channel Recording Headstage.
- Detailed information about the electrodes, including their positions, groups, and labels.
- Time intervals marking the start and stop times of Coelenterazine infusion.

**Type 2 NWB Files:**
These files focus primarily on extracellular electrophysiology data:
- Extracellular ephys data acquired at 20 kHz, downsampled to 10 kHz.
- Detailed electrode information similar to the Type 1 files.
- Time intervals marking the injection times of Coelenterazine.
- Metadata consistent with the experimental setup and protocols.
