### Experiment Summary

The Visual Behavior Ophys dataset was generated by the Allen Institute for Brain Science using in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging to measure the activity of genetically identified neurons in the visual cortex of mice. The mice were performing a go/no-go visual change detection task, where neuronal activity was recorded over multiple days in varying sensory and behavioral contexts, including familiar and novel stimuli and passive exposure sessions. The dataset is designed to evaluate the influence of experience, expectation, and task engagement on neural coding and dynamics in excitatory, Vip inhibitory, and Sst inhibitory cell populations.

The complete dataset includes neural and behavioral measurements from 107 well-trained mice across 703 in vivo 2-photon imaging sessions, covering 326 unique fields of view and totaling 50,476 recorded cortical neurons. In addition, the dataset provides the full behavioral training history of all imaged mice, thus enabling investigation into task learning, behavioral strategy, and inter-animal variability. A total of 4,782 behavior sessions are available for comprehensive analysis.

### Available Data in the NWB Files

The available data in the NWB files are grouped by different formats, each containing specific information regarding the experiment and recordings. Each file includes:

- Acquisition data such as voltage signals from the running wheel encoder.
- Metadata about the devices used, particularly the Allen Brain Observatory Scientifica 2P Rig.
- Description of experiments conducted, such as associative training and operant behavior training sessions, specifying the types of stimuli and the session parameters.
- Metadata on the subjects involved and the behavioral task parameters.
- Detailed intervals of stimulus presentations and experimental trials, providing data points like start and stop times, stimulus details, and trial outcomes.
- Processing modules for behavioral actions such as licking, rewards, and running speed, containing timestamps and indices related to these activities.
- Specific stimulus presentation data, with templates and timeseries for grating and natural images.
