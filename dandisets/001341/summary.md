# Experimental Abstract

In this study, we investigate neural activity in the C2 barrel column of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of mice during a tactile virtual reality (VR) whisker-guided navigation task. Mice were head-fixed on a suspended ball and exposed to a virtual environment where lateral movements of the environment's walls were dynamically adjusted based on the movements of the mice. This setup mimics linear navigation tasks where mice use their C2 whiskers to steer through a virtual corridor by responding to wall movements. The experiment aimed to understand the role of the barrel cortex in decision-making processes during navigation tasks that engage only tactile senses, without any form of reward. This was evaluated through a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) task where mice experienced baseline straight trials followed by turns that provided contralateral or ipsilateral stimulation to the recording site.

The investigation reported here encompasses two main objectives: quantifying neural responses during these tactile navigation tasks and distinguishing decision-making pathways controlled by whisker inputs. Electrophysiological data were recorded to identify spiking activity in response to controlled visual stimuli movements. Such experiments provide a framework to unravel the sensorimotor integration and decision-making circuits in the barrel cortex, which are instrumental for navigation based on tactile stimuli.

# NWB File Data Description

The NWB files in this dataset contain comprehensive experimental data illustrating the electrophysiological recordings related to the barrel cortex navigation experiments. The files include time series data that capture the lateral and forward distances traversed by the mice, alongside calculated speeds in these respective dimensions. Also present are trial numbers and timings that assist in defining each trial's framework within the dataset. A wealth of electrophysiological data, like spike times, spike sorting parameters, and quality metrics, provide insights into the units of analysis. Parameters such as amplitude cutoff, firing rates, isolation distances, and signal-to-noise ratios—crucial for assessing neural activity—are included alongside metadata identifying unit-specific classifications and cortical depth annotations. Each NWB file carries identifiers and timestamps to ensure traceability of the experimental sessions.
