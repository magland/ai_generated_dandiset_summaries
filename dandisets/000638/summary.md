### Experiment Summary

This experiment aimed to investigate the electrophysiological dynamics of the hippocampus (HPC) and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) in both control and epileptic mice. Using dual-region silicon probes, acute recordings were obtained while head-fixed mice navigated a virtual reality (VR) environment. The dataset includes recordings from mice both 3 weeks and 8 weeks after pilocarpine treatment, a procedure known to induce epilepsy. By utilizing this setup, the researchers likely intended to study neural circuit alterations associated with epilepsy and to understand how these changes impact spatial navigation and related behaviors.

### NWB File Description

The NWB files provide comprehensive datasets that include both raw and processed electrophysiological data, behavioral data, and metadata. Each file contains multiple `ElectricalSeries` datasets corresponding to different shank recordings, specifying the electrode group's local reference. Behavioral data are recorded as `BehavioralTimeSeries` or `BehavioralEpochs`, capturing metrics such as licking, reward delivery, speed, and positional data recorded in the VR environment. In addition, the processed data files include specific low-frequency oscillations, such as theta band (5-12 Hz) filtered signals, aiding in the analysis of neural oscillatory dynamics. Detailed electrode information and spiking data are also stored, including spike times and unit classification.
