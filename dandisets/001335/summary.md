In this study, we explore the neural response dynamics in the hippocampus of head-fixed mice during the presentation of odor sequences, utilizing state-of-the-art Neuropixels technology. The investigation aims to decipher the intricate neuronal processing within the hippocampus when exposed to olfactory stimuli, which are crucial for behaviors such as navigation and memory formation. Wild-type mice were exposed to various sequences of odors administered in distinct blocks to allow for the assessment of the hippocampus's ability to discriminate between different odorants and sequences. This setup aims to map the odor-evoked neuronal activity and contribute to a better understanding of how the brain encodes and processes complex sensory information.

The generated NWB files encapsulate detailed recordings of extracellular electrophysiological data, collected through 4-shank NPX2.0 devices, providing high-resolution insights at the level of individual neurons. Each recording includes metadata on electrode placements, specifically detailing their locations in either the left or right hemisphere of the hippocampus, alongside time markers for when different odors were presented. Accompanying the raw electrophysiological data are processed local field potentials (LFP) subsampled at 2500 Hz, and bandpass filtered between 1 and 400 Hz, highlighting slow-wave oscillatory activity that pairs with the intricate spike data from 283 identified units. The dataset meticulously details the intervals of odor presentation, contributing to the temporal correlation analysis between stimulus and neural response.
