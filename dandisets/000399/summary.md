## Abstract

This study investigates the synaptic mechanisms underlying behavioral time scale plasticity using an all-optical physiology approach in the hippocampus of Mus musculus (house mouse). Utilizing advanced optical electrophysiology and multi-electrode extracellular recording techniques, the researchers explored the dynamic interplay between synaptic activity and behavioral adaptations in a virtual reality (VR) environment. The study aims to elucidate how synaptic plasticity at the cellular level translates to behavioral modifications over time scales pertinent to cognition and learning.

Experiments were performed on 19 mice, employing a custom-designed microscope for optical electrophysiology. The electrophysiological recordings focused on capturing the electrical activities of neurons in the hippocampus, a brain region intricately involved in memory formation and spatial navigation. The data collected provides valuable insights into the electrode groups' spatial and temporal dimensions, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of synaptic efficacy changes during behaviorally relevant tasks.

## Available Data in NWB Files

The Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files harbor detailed electrophysiological data acquired from the mice. Each file, created on 2023-06-13, includes data on electrical series acquired through a custom-designed microscope for optical electrophysiology. The files contain information on electrode group placements, including attributes like location and coordinates (x, y, z), critical for spatial mapping of recorded activities. Metadata in the files includes information about the subject, experimental setup, and the chronological context of the recordings. Experimental details, such as the VR environment descriptions, session times, and affiliations to Stanford University, are also provided.
