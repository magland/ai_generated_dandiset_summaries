### Abstract

We present a novel fluorescence microscopy design that enables imaging of thousands of neurons in freely behaving mice and hundreds of neurons in juvenile songbirds. This innovative light path circumvents traditional illumination optics, allowing for the construction of head-mounted microscopes with significantly reduced weight and an increased field of view (FOV). In this study, we introduce two microscopes: one optimized for a large FOV (~4 mm, 1.4 g) and another for minimal weight (1.0 mm, 1.0 g). This dataset comprises calcium imaging data from our lightweight-optimized microscope. Our methodology involved stereotactically targeting the primary visual and somatosensory regions of the mouse brain, performing viral injections of GCaMP7f, and implanting a glass window to allow for in vivo recording as the mouse explored a circular maze.

#### Available Data in NWB Files

The NWB file contains detailed datasets and metadata related to the experiment. Key contents include:
- **Calcium Imaging Data**: Captured at approximately 30 frames per second, in grayscale.
- **Behavioral Video**: Concurrent recording of the mouse's movement within its environment.
- **Imaging Metrics**: Details about the imaging plane, optical channels, and device configurations.
- **Processed Data**: Includes df/F traces and segmented ROIs from calcium imaging sessions.
- **Supplementary Information**: ROI centroids, image masks, and summary images that support the processed data.
