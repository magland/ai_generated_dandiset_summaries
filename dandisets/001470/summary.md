## Abstract

This study investigates the neuronal activity within the hippocampus of head-fixed mice during odor presentation using neuropixels probes for electrophysiological recording. The mice are exposed to varying olfactory stimuli while their neural response is recorded, aiming to elucidate the hippocampal neural code for olfactory processing. Given the hippocampus's role in memory and spatial navigation, this study's purpose is likely to explore how odor recognition is integrated into the broader network of sensory and memory processing. The results could provide novel insights into odor-driven behavior and its neural underpinnings, potentially informing models of memory and sensory integration.

## NWB File Description

The NWB file contains detailed electrophysiological data recorded using Neuropixels 2.0 probes with a four-shank configuration, capable of high-density extracellular recording. The dataset includes acquisition traces from two sets of electrodes, each comprising 384 channels, capturing extensive neuronal activity data. Additionally, labeled events from digital channels and analog data from NIDQ boards are recorded, capturing a comprehensive picture of the timing and dynamics of neural activation. The dataset encompasses metadata linked to the electrodes, including channel reference, electrode group information, and sampling specifics. Each electrode is associated with detailed location data and characteristics, ensuring comprehensive documentation for further analysis and replication.
