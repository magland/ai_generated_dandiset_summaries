## Abstract

The present study investigates the physiological properties and behavioral correlates of hippocampal granule cells and mossy cells in the house mouse (Mus musculus) using electrophysiological and behavioral techniques. The research aims to elucidate the role of these specific hippocampal cell types during various behavioral states, particularly during exploration in a theta maze. Granule cells and mossy cells were recorded under conditions of open exploration, and their activity patterns were analyzed using local field potentials (LFP) and spike sorting techniques to uncover their functional contributions.

Comprehensive electrophysiological data were collected using silicon electrodes implanted in the hippocampus. The recordings were carefully synchronized with behavioral data, capturing the position and state of the subject animals to establish correlations between neuronal activity and behavior. The dataset is a significant contribution to understanding hippocampal function, potentially highlighting cellular mechanisms underlying spatial navigation and other cognitive processes.

## Data Description

The available NWB files contain extensive electrophysiological recordings and behavioral data. These files include raw sensor data from two position sensors, metadata about the extracellular electrodes, and various types of stimuli presentation annotations. The data encompass information on the positioning of electrodes within the brain, the electrophysiological properties of recorded channels, and unit-specific data including spike times, waveforms, and cell types. Additionally, the files contain segmented data on sleep states and processed LFP signals including frequency band decomposition necessary for detailed analysis of neuronal activity.

Specifically, data spans detailed electrode information such as the coordinates and impedance values of individual channels, LFP recordings for each electrode, and intermediate processed data such as the theta and gamma phase components. Behavioral data includes time intervals marking the sleep states of animals, enhancing the ability to correlate neural activity with specific behavioral states. This multi-layered dataset thus provides a robust foundation for deeper insights into hippocampal functioning during behavior.
