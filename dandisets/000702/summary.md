## Abstract

This study examines the swimming behavior of zebrafish, Danio rerio, in a controlled environment set to a uniform temperature of 26°C. Conducted at THE Ohio State University by investigator Kaarthik Balakrishnan, the experiments aim to understand behavioral responses to constant temperature conditions. The research utilizes a gradient behavior chamber to track movements and directional preferences of zebrafish larvae, with particular attention to their spatial positioning and heading directions. The experiments, funded by the National Institutes of Health under award number 5 R01 NS 123887-03, provide insights into the thermal preference behavior and spatial navigation strategies of zebrafish under uniform thermal conditions.

Data collection for the project involved monitoring individual zebrafish in both left and right lanes of the gradient chamber, with a high temporal resolution of 100 Hz and spatial resolution of 7 px/mm. This precise measurement enables an in-depth analysis of behavioral patterns such as fish heading, chamber position, and local temperature at the position of the fish. The dataset highlights responses in a standardized environment, potentially contributing to a broader understanding of thermal and spatial behavior in aquatic organisms.

## NWB Files Data Description

The Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files within this Dandiset include comprehensive data on zebrafish behavior in a constant temperature environment. Each NWB file contains data segments capturing the fish's heading direction, spatial positioning within the swim chamber, and ambient temperature at the fish's location. The dataset is organized into processing modules for both left and right swim lanes, documenting distinct behavioral parameters such as chamber position (SpatialSeries) and fish heading in radians (CompassDirection). Further details include temperatures recorded as Behavioral TimeSeries, encapsulating the environmental conditions experienced by the fish. The NWB files also store raw experiment metadata and scratch data, such as specific temperature settings and fish identifiers, contributing to the holistic understanding of the experimental setup and outcomes.
