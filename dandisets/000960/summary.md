# Experiment Summary

This experiment aims to investigate neuronal activity within the primary visual cortex (V1) of a mouse during a visual spatial detection task. The visual stimuli include grating patterns with various contrasts and phases, as well as task-irrelevant flashing bars to probe attentional responses. Electrophysiological recordings were made using Neuropixels 1.0 Phase 3B probes, capturing both spikes and local field potentials (LFP). These data allow for comprehensive analysis of neural representations and attentional modulation in the visual cortex.

The experiment was carried out by James Zhuang at Georgia Tech (GATech) under protocol A100171. The subject of the study was a mouse identified as M231117_1. The recording session started at 14:55:42 on December 31, 2023, and included multiple trials, each presenting grating and flashing bar stimuli. Orofacial movements and pupil area were also tracked at 30 frames per second to correlate neural activity with behavioral and attentional states.

# NWB File Data Description

The available NWB file contains extensive datasets related to extracellular electrophysiology and behavioral tracking. Key datasets include:
- **Extracellular Electrophysiology**: Information about 383 electrodes including their location (x, y, z coordinates), impedance (imp), and filtering. Electrode group data is also provided.
- **Electrophysiological Data**: Units table contains information on 34 recorded units including assigned channel number, cell type, cluster class, cluster number, location, cortical layer, mean waveform, spike times, and spike indices.
- **Visual Stimuli Information**: Data on each trial, including grating azimuth, contrast, target phase, as well as the onset and offset times of both the grating and probe stimuli.
- **LFP Data**: Local field potential records from all electrodes.
- **Behavioral Tracking**: Motion energy data for orofacial movements and pupil area tracked during behavior trials.
