# Experiment Summary

The dataset "Neural circuits underlying divergent visuomotor strategies of zebrafish and Danionella cerebrum" explores the neural mechanisms that govern visuomotor coordination in two teleost species with different ecological behaviors and strategies. The research aims to comprehend how Danionella cerebrum and zebrafish (Danio rerio) respond to visual stimuli, specifically focusing on the optomotor response (OMR) which is crucial for maintaining body stability in response to optic flow. By comparing these two species, the study illuminates the variations in swimming patterns: continuous swimming with sharp turns in D. cerebrum versus burst-and-glide locomotion in zebrafish. This comparative analysis leverages advanced techniques such as two-photon calcium imaging and behavioral tracking to profile neural circuit activity and quantify behavioral patterns under various stimuli.

The study reveals species-specific adaptations in neural circuitry and behavior management. D. cerebrum shows a higher swimming speed but lacks the direction-dependent velocity modulation that is prominent in zebrafish. Moreover, D. cerebrum features more monocularly active neurons and demonstrates prolonged directed swimming activity across stimuli, diverging from the zebrafishâ€™s strategy of diminishing tail movement in response to turning cues. Investigating the role of locomotion-associated neurons and their extended activity in D. cerebrum suggests the presence of conserved neural motifs that independently modulate movement dynamics, emphasizing the complexity and diversity of teleost sensory-motor circuitry. These findings shed light on the evolutionary adaptations of OMR pathways, establishing an essential groundwork for future exploration into the neural basis of locomotion strategies.

# NWB Data Description

The NWB files within this dataset provide comprehensive behavioral tracking data on the swimming patterns of zebrafish and Danionella cerebrum. Data captured include the orientation, angular velocity, and position of fish (x, y, and velocities in both dimensions) alongside stimulus indices and identifiers. Type 1 NWB files detail freely swimming behavior and tracking, featuring datasets associated with positional and directional metrics. Type 2 NWB files supplement this with additional parameters such as the distance traveled between frames. This dataset, divided into 37 NWB files (25 of Type 1 and 12 of Type 2), encapsulates precise measurements and experimental conditions critical for understanding the neural circuits underlying divergent visuomotor strategies across species.
