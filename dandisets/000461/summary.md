# Cohen Tickertapes Exploratory Data 1

### Abstract

This dataset encompasses exploratory research into the second generation of molecular tickertapes developed in the Adam Cohen Lab. The study involving twelve Canis lupus familiaris (domestic dogs) aims to advance the use of two-photon excitation microscopy to achieve detailed cellular imaging. This method allows researchers to visualize cellular processes in live tissues with high spatial resolution and minimal invasiveness. The objective of this exploration is likely to refine molecular tickertapes—a technique for recording biochemical events within cells over time—enhancing the understanding of dynamic cellular functions.

The practical importance of this work lies in its ability to provide real-time, high-resolution insights into complex biological processes. This, in turn, could have profound implications for various fields, including neuroscience and molecular biology, by enabling more precise tracking and analysis of cellular events. The exploratory dataset represents a significant step toward the optimal application of two-photon microscopy in capturing these detailed molecular interactions.

### Data Available in NWB Files

The NWB files in this dataset primarily consist of imaging data derived from two-photon excitation microscopy. Key elements included are:

- `TwoPhotonSeries`: Represents the imaging data captured through the microscopy sessions.
- `ImagingPlane`: Details the specific imaging plane used during data acquisition.
- `OpticalChannel`: Provides information about the optical channels employed during imaging.
- `Device`: Includes metadata about the specific devices used for data capture.
- `Subject`: Contains information about the subjects (domestic dogs) involved in the study.
- Session metadata such as `file_create_date`, `session_description`, `session_start_time`, and `timestamps_reference_time` which document the details of each imaging session.

This collection of NWB files provides a comprehensive set of data for analyzing the imaging outcomes and refining the two-photon microscopy techniques.
