### Abstract

The study investigates the difference in electroporation patterns produced by a train of single pulses and a train of paired pulses. Electroporation is a technique used to increase cell membrane permeability, enabling the introduction of various substances into cells. The experiment aimed to compare the efficacy and patterns of electroporation between two pulsatile protocols: single pulse trains and paired pulse trains. The study was conducted using a sophisticated setup with a triangular electrode array to ensure precise control over the electrical pulses delivered to a cell monolayer. The experimental conditions employed a 5 paired-pulse train, each pulse lasting 600+600 ns, with a frequency of 833 kHz and an amplitude of 2 kV.

The data acquired from these experiments provide valuable insights into electroporation efficiency and cellular response under different pulsatile conditions. The detailed imaging and precise control over experimental variables allow for a comprehensive comparison, potentially informing optimized electroporation protocols for various applications in biological and medical research.

### Data Description

The NWB files generated from these experiments contain high-resolution imaging data captured using an IX83 microscope equipped with a MS-2000 scanning stage, X-Cite 110LED illuminator, and ORCA-Flash4 sCMOS camera. The files include 144 images captured in a 12x12 grid from a six-well plate and an additional 216 images taken with DAPI and FITC filter cubes. All images were automatically stitched to create a final composite image. Imaging was conducted with a 10Ã—, 0.38 NA objective lens, providing detailed visual data of the electroporated areas. The data also include metadata such as session ID, the identifier of the subject, timestamps, and details about the experimental setup.
