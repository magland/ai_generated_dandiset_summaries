# Use of MHz Compression ns Electric Pulse NG-CanCan Protocols to Minimize Near Electrode Ablation

## Abstract

This study aimed to enhance the Next Generation (NG) CanCan protocols for delivering electric pulse packets using MHz compression. Electric pulses were delivered at a frequency of 0.2 MHz, which significantly reduced the cell ablation near the electrodes while maintaining effectiveness at the center, compared to delivery at a 1 Hz frequency. The experimental setup included a four-electrode array, with cell permeabilization evaluated using YoPro-1 and cell death assessed two hours post-protocol delivery using Propidium Iodide. The results demonstrated the potential for MHz compression to be used in optimizing the delivery of electric pulses, potentially improving the safety and efficacy of the CanCan protocols. This work was supported by NIH grant 1R21EY034258.

The four-electrode array allowed for the application of controlled electric pulses, with initial pulses delivered at high amplitudes from single electrodes, followed by sequential pulses at reduced amplitudes from pairs of electrodes. This sequence was repeated at specified frequencies and intervals, either maintaining the same frequency or switching the active electrode. Control protocols were also conducted under similar conditions but without the CanCan-specific pulse sequences. The evaluation of cellular effects post-exposure provided insight into the mechanisms underlying pulse delivery and cell response, contributing to optimizing electric pulse protocols for minimizing unwanted cellular damage near electrodes.

## NWB File Description

The dataset comprises 54 NWB files, offering a comprehensive record of the conducted experiments. Each file includes data from single time point imaging using fluorescence microscopy. The imaging setup involved the use of an Olympus IX83 P2ZF microscope with a Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash4.0 detector, and images were captured at a magnification of 4X using the NA=0.16 objective. Each image contained data from two exposure areas: one subjected to the experimental protocol and another serving as control. Critical sessions description includes the delivery parameters for electric pulses, detailed electrode setup, and dye usage for staining and evaluation, providing a robust dataset for analyzing cell permeability and death.
