## Abstract

This study investigates the impact of disrupting septal GABAergic activity on hippocampal and neocortical functions using the DREADDs (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs) technique. The experiment involved genetically-modified mice (Mus musculus) in which the septal GABAergic activity was modulated through DREADD technology, allowing precise control over neuronal inhibition and activation. The primary objective was to assess the resultant effects on electrophysiological dynamics within the hippocampus and neocortex as the animals performed tasks in a virtual hallway environment. By altering GABAergic activity, researchers aim to enhance understanding of septal contributions to neural circuitry, particularly regarding spatial navigation and memory consolidation processes.

The study utilized advanced electrophysiological approaches, recording neuronal spikes and local field potentials with high-density 128-channel silicon probe arrays. Through electrophysiological assessments, this study sought not only to elucidate the septum's role in modulating hippocampal rhythm and networks but also to observe behavioral alterations during spatial navigation tasks. Trials were structured to capture the initiation and cessation of locomotion in a virtual environment, offering insights into temporal neural correlates. The results are expected to contribute substantially to the current knowledge of septal region functions and their influence on cognitive processes.

## NWB File Data Description

The Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files contain comprehensive electrophysiological datasets gathered from mice subjects. The data encompass time-series recordings from 128-channel silicon probe arrays, capturing spike train activities across different neurons, organized within a units table that enumerates every detected unit and its corresponding spike times. The dataset also provides detailed information regarding electrode positions and configurations, specifying electrode groupings and labels for spatial reference. Trials were interval-time stamped, recording start and stop times compatible with the experimental session timeline. Additionally, the acquisition includes metadata on devices used, links to electrode profiles, unit identifiers, and session details, collectively facilitating in-depth analysis and reproducibility.
