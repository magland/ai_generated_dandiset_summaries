## Experiment Summary

The experiment conducted by Aery Jones et al. (2021) focused on the role of GABAergic interneurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3 regions in modulating the neural activity of the hippocampal CA1 region. Three different cohorts of genetically modified mice (PVCre, SSTCre, and PVCre/SSTCre) were used, and these mice were injected with either AAV5-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry (hM4D) or AAV5-hSyn-DIO-mCherry (empty vector) in DG and CA3. Additionally, these mice were subjected to vehicle or CNO injections preceding the recording sessions. The primary aim was to understand how the inhibition of specific interneuron populations impacts neural drive signals to CA1 during both rest and active movement.

Recording sessions involved capturing electrophysiological data from all layers of the CA1, CA3, and DG regions while the mice were either resting in their home cage or navigating a linear track. This comprehensive approach allowed for the analysis of internal and external neural drive signatures and their potential regulation by specific interneurons. The findings, as described in a preprint on bioRxiv, provide intriguing insights into the bidirectional modulation of hippocampal activity by GABAergic interneurons, which may hold implications for understanding neuropsychiatric disorders.

## Available Data in NWB Files

The NWB files contain extensive electrophysiological and behavioral data from the experiment. For both types of NWB files, the following data are available:

- **Device Information:** Specific arrays used for recordings, such as A1x32-6mm-50-703-CM32 and A4x8-5mm-400-200-703-CM32.
- **Electrophysiological Data:** Dynamic tables with details about electrode configurations, including filtering, group assignments, impedance, labels, locations, and reference points. 
- **Electrode Groups:** Detailed groupings for different shanks, aligning with the specific devices used.
- **LFP Data:** Local field potential data recorded from all electrodes, organized in appropriate processing modules.
- **Units Data:** Information on multi-unit activity (MUA) including spike times and associated electrodes.
- **Behavioral Data:** Position data captured during the experiments, which is crucial for correlating neural activity with behavioral states.
- **Session Metadata:** Extensive metadata for each recording session, including session IDs, timestamps, pharmacology details (vehicle or CNO), and experimental conditions.
