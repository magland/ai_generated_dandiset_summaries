## Summary of Experiment

The study aimed to investigate how neurons in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL) respond to cognitive boundaries and how these responses structure episodic memory formation. Single-neuron electrophysiological data were recorded from patients with intractable epilepsy who were implanted with depth electrodes and Behnke-Fried microwires. The experiment included tasks such as encoding, recognition, and time discrimination trials designed to elicit neural responses contingent on the presentation of cognitive boundaries. This investigation is part of a broader effort to understand the neural mechanisms underlying episodic memory.

The data collected are intended to reveal how neurons in the MTL encode different forms of boundaries that demarcate episodes in a task-sensitive manner. By examining neuronal firing rates across tasks involving various types of cognitive boundaries—both 'hard' boundaries that strongly segment events and 'soft' boundaries that are more subtle—researchers aim to map the specific role these neurons play in memory segmentation and recall processes.

## Description of Data Available in NWB Files

The NWB files contain extensive electrophysiological recordings and behavioral data from the cognitive boundary tasks. Key elements include:

- **Events and Markers**: Time-series data indicating the onset and offset of stimuli, fixation crosses, probes, and participant responses.
- **Experiment IDs**: Demarcation of different trial types (encoding, recognition, and time discrimination).
- **Devices**: Details on the Macro-Micro Hybrid Depth Electrodes used for recordings, which include microwires with a diameter of 40 microns.
- **Electrode Groups**: Information about extracellular electrophysiological recordings from the microwires.
- **Interval Tables**: Detailed specifications for encoding, recognition, and time discrimination tasks, including timestamps, boundary types (no boundary, soft boundary, hard boundary), and stimulus identifiers.
- **Unit Data**: Electrophysiological data from individual neuron units, including spike times and electrode associations.

Each NWB file also includes metadata such as session IDs, experiment descriptions, and related publications, providing essential context for the time-series and unit data.
