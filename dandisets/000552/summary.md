### Abstract

The study investigates how preconfigured dynamics in the hippocampus are influenced by the embryonic birthdate and neurogenesis rate of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Using in-utero electroporation to mark neurons over four embryonic days during peak hippocampal neurogenesis, the study explores the functional properties of these neurons in adult, freely-moving mice. It was observed that neurons sharing the same birthdate displayed unique connectivity patterns, coactivity across various brain states, and assembly dynamics. Additionally, these neurons exhibited topographical organization where anatomically clustered neurons had overlapping spatial representations, suggesting that both the embryonic birthdate and neurogenesis rate shape the wiring and functional features of hippocampal neurons. These findings emphasize the role of sequential neurogenesis in establishing preconfigured forms of adult hippocampal network dynamics.

### Data Description

The dataset consists of 117 NWB files with data from 17 subjects. Key data types include electrophysiological recordings, behavioral data, and spatial mapping information. The dataset captures a multitude of variables such as ElectricalSeries, LFP, SpatialSeries, and various processing modules like spike sorting data and ripple metrics. Behavioral data includes experimental epochs, trials, and subject position tracking. Electrophysiological data covers detailed metadata about extracellular electrodes, spike times for different units, and LFP data. The data also incorporates intervals pertaining to sleep states and ripple events.
