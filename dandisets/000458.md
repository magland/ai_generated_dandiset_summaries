## Summary of Dandiset DANDI:000458/0.230317.0039

### Experiments
This dataset involves simultaneous recordings of electroencephalography (EEG), extracellular electrophysiology using Neuropixels probes, and cortical electrical stimulation in head-fixed mice. Recordings were made during both wakefulness and isoflurane anesthesia, with some sessions also including a recovery period after anesthesia. The mice were free to move or rest on a rotating disc during the experiments.

The electrical stimulation was applied to the cortex, and in some cases, visual stimuli were presented as well. The experiments were designed to investigate neural activity in different brain states (awake, anesthetized, and recovery), and data were collected to examine cortical-thalamic interactions and other phenomena associated with brain stimulation.

### Data Available
The dataset includes recordings from 23 subjects and contains 24 NWB files. The files provide:

1. **EEG Recordings**:
   - Voltage signals from a 30-channel surface EEG array.
   - Timestamps and electrode metadata.

2. **Neuropixels Probe Recordings**:
   - Local field potentials (LFP) and spike times from multiple Neuropixels probes.
   - Spike-sorted data with metadata on unit characteristics (spike waveforms, brain region, etc.).

3. **Behavioral Data**:
   - Wheel-running speed, computed from the subject's movement on a rotating disc.
   - Information on the epochs of wakefulness, anesthesia, and recovery (if applicable).

4. **Stimulation Trials**:
   - Detailed trial information for each stimulation delivered during the session.
   - Parameters such as electrical current, target brain regions, and cortical layer depths for each stimulation.
   - Validity indicators for trials (e.g., excluding trials with electrical artifacts or off-target stimulations).

### Experimental Conditions
- **Awake, anesthetized, and recovery** states were recorded.
- **Visual and electrical stimuli** were interleaved in some sessions, with visual stimuli presented in the right visual field.
- Stimulus trials include detailed annotations on the conditions, running behavior, and stimulus parameters.

### Additional Information
- **Spike Sorting**: Spikes were sorted using Kilosort 2.0, and only high-quality units were included in the analysis.
- **Data Standards**: All data follow the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) standard, making it compatible with a wide range of analysis tools.

### Key Keywords
- EEG, Neuropixels, electrical stimulation, brain states, cortico-thalamic interactions

### Publications
This dataset is associated with a publication that can be accessed [here](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.84630.1).

This dataset offers rich multi-modal neural recordings and behavioral data that can be reused for studies on brain states, cortical stimulation effects, and neural dynamics under anesthesia.
