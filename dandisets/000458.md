## 000458: Simultaneous electroencephalography, extracellular electrophysiology, and cortical electrical stimulation in head-fixed mice

### General Overview
This Dandiset records complex neurophysiological experiments conducted at the Allen Institute, focusing on the interaction between electroencephalography (EEG) and extracellular electrophysiology via Neuropixels probes in head-fixed mice. These experiments involved simultaneous EEG recordings, extracellular recordings, and direct cortical electrical stimulation. Mice were observed under various states including awake, anesthetized, and recovery phases.

### Detailed NWB File Content
#### NWB File Structure
Each NWB file within this dataset provides a rich set of data encompassing:
- **EEG recordings** from a 30-channel surface array, capturing raw EEG signals and associated electrode information.
- **Local Field Potentials (LFPs)** recorded from Neuropixels probes, with raw signal data and electrode specifics.
- **Spike data** including spike times and associated metadata for each detected neural unit, processed through spike sorting algorithms.
- **Behavioral data** detailing the subjectâ€™s locomotion through measurements like running speed and corresponding epochs.
- **Stimulation data** noting the timing, location, and intensity of electrical stimuli delivered to cortical regions.

#### Example Path References
- `/acquisition/ElectricalSeriesEEG` contains the continuous EEG recording data with timestamps.
- `/acquisition/LFPprobeB/ElectricalSeriesprobeB` and similar paths for other probes detail the LFP recordings from various Neuropixels probes.
- `/units` where sorted neuronal unit activity is logged, including metrics like presence ratio, spike times, and waveform properties.
