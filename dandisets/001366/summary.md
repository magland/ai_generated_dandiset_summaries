## Abstract

The present study aims to compare methodologies for quantifying surface vessel diameter and pulsatility in mice. The experimental procedure involves imaging pial vessels to measure these parameters, which are critical indicators of cerebrovascular health. Through this study, we strive to enhance understanding of how different analytical techniques can impact the interpretation of vascular dynamics. Specifically, the research focuses on applying Radon transform and full width at half maximum (FWHM) methods to assess vessel diameter and pulsation, providing insights that may inform approaches to vascular diagnosis and treatment.

In the experimental setup, the skulls of mice were thinned around the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and stabilized with a head plate to ensure accurate measurement during imaging sessions. Movies capturing the vessel dynamics were acquired using 16-bit grayscale imaging techniques. Such high-resolution data facilitate the detailed analysis necessary for a comprehensive comparison of quantification methods, thereby contributing to the field of vascular imaging. The outcomes of these analyses are expected to provide valuable information that could optimize diagnostic procedures for conditions involving vascular impairment.

## NWB File Data Description

The NWB files in this dataset include imaging data of pial vessel activity in mice. Each file stores a 16-bit grayscale movie detailing the pulsatility and diameter of the MCA pial vessels. Data collection was meticulously conducted by the researcher Qinwen Huang at the University of Rochester, employing a standardized approach to thinning the mouse skulls and fitting them with head plates for stabilization during measurement. The dataset consists of two sessions, providing a basis for intra- and inter-methodological comparisons across subjects.
