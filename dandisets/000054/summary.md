## Abstract

The current dataset represents the experiments conducted by Plitt and Giocomo (2021), which explore experience-dependent contextual coding in the hippocampus of mice. The study investigates how neural representations in the hippocampal region adapt during spatial foraging tasks in a two-tower virtual reality environment. Using two-photon calcium imaging, the researchers track neuronal activity and behavioral responses to delineate the mechanisms behind contextual modulation and spatial navigation. The study aims to elucidate the role of experience in shaping hippocampal coding dynamics, providing insights into the neural basis of memory and learning.

To capture detailed neuronal and behavioral embeddings, the dataset contains continuous two-photon imaging data coupled with comprehensive behavioral recordings. The experimental paradigm involves mice foraging in a virtual reality setup, with various stimuli presented to assess behavioral and neural responses. Insights from this study are anticipated to shed light on the plasticity of hippocampal circuits, offering profound implications for understanding spatial memory and navigation.

## Data Description

The dataset includes a total of 85 NWB files capturing various aspects of the experiment. The majority of the files (76) include two-photon series data and detailed behavioral time series, such as position, speed, licks, and mouse's response to the virtual track. These files also contain information on the stimuli presented during the sessions, including details about rewards and background jitter.

Type 1 NWB files hold two-photon imaging data, including fluorescence deconvolved responses and neuropil signals, as well as image segmentation outcomes with segmented ROIs. Type 2 and 3 files also contain behavioral time series data, providing a thorough account of the mouse's positional data, speed, and other critical behavioral metrics. Type 4 files encapsulate specifics about the two-photon imaging sessions and the behavioral data, similar to type 2 and 3 files but from different experimental sessions.
