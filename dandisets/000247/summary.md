### Abstract

The dataset provides comprehensive 2-photon calcium imaging data of oviposition descending neurons (oviDNs) in head-fixed Drosophila melanogaster during oviposition behavior. The primary aim appears to be investigating the neural correlates of egg-laying behavior, in relation to environmental conditions such as substrate sucrose and agarose concentrations. The flies were positioned on an agarose-laden wheel, mimicking natural oviposition conditions, which allowed the researchers to record both neuronal activity and corresponding behavior data. This dataset supports the findings discussed in the publication "A rise-to-threshold signal for a relative value deliberation" (preprint on bioRxiv), and encapsulates various fly genotypes and environmental variations to explore neural dynamics during decision-making processes related to egg-laying.

### Data Description

Each NWB file in the dataset corresponds to an individual recording session of a single fly, with a total of 29 NWB files available. The files contain time series data including 2-photon calcium imaging data from identified oviDN neurons (`left oviDNa`, `left oviDNb`, `right oviDNa`, `right oviDNb`) and their respective mean signals. Behavioral data encompasses metrics such as wheel position, body angle, body length, proboscis length, velocity, sucrose, and agarose concentrations of the substrate. Some files also contain stimulation data, indicating external perturbations applied during the recordings.
