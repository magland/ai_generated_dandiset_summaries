# Abstract

This study explores the neuronal response to transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS) in the somatosensory cortex of rats by employing a novel ultraflexible nanoelectric thread electrode. Traditional rigid electrodes introduce vibration artifacts under high-intensity ultrasound stimulation, which limits the exploration of higher ultrasound intensities. By using a flexible electrode, this study overcomes such limitations, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of neuronal spiking activities at varied ultrasound pressures and parameters. The experiment tests five different in situ ultrasound pressures ranging from 100 to 1300 kPa. Further, the study investigates the effects of varying the duty cycle and pulse repetition frequency (PRF) on neuronal responses. Specifically, duty cycles of 0.6% to 90% were tested at a consistent peak-peak pressure, while PRFs ranging from 30 Hz to 4500 Hz were evaluated at a steady duty cycle of 30%.

Data were collected from 505 trials conducted every 2 seconds with a 10% jitter, using a 128-element array transducer operating at a fundamental frequency of 1500 kHz. The findings from this study are significant in understanding how different ultrasound parameters influence neuronal activity and hold implications for the optimization of tFUS as a non-invasive neuromodulation tool. The results offer an invaluable contribution to the body of knowledge on the safe and effective deployment of ultrasound in neural therapies.

# NWB File Data Description

The NWB files from the dataset provide a detailed recording of the neuronal activity in response to the tFUS experiments. Each file contains an ElectricalSeries data structure documenting the electrical signals captured by the ultraflexible electrodes implanted in the rat somatosensory cortex. The dataset includes information on the electrode configurations, such as electrode locations, impedances, and positioning in 3D space. Metadata in the NWB files include session descriptions, trial onset, and offset timings for the 505 trials recorded per session.

Detailed information about the electrodes is also documented, including the grouping of electrodes into shanks and their respective connections to the flexible 'NET probe' device. Each NWB file provides experimental metadata such as the identifier, device specifications, session-specific start times, and timestamps reference time, creating a comprehensive framework for analyzing the effects of ultrasound stimulation on cortical firing patterns.
