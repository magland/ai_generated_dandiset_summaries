## Abstract

The experiment encompasses calcium imaging of neural activity in **Mus musculus** (house mouse) using a two-photon microscope. The primary focus is on acquiring and processing optical physiology data to understand cellular and population dynamics in the brain. Specific techniques utilized include analytical methods for data quantification and surgical techniques for sample preparation and imaging.

Data from this experiment are stored and organized using the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) data standard. This structured format facilitates the integration, sharing, and re-analysis of neurophysiological data within the neuroscience community. The summary provided showcases a test session from DataJoint's calcium imaging pipeline, emphasizing the capabilities of their standardized data processing and storage solutions.

## Data Description

The NWB files include comprehensive metadata and detailed data streams. Key components cover:

- Device details: The use of a two-photon microscope designated as 'ScannerA.'
- Optophysiology elements: Descriptions of imaging planes, optical channels, and devices.
- Subject information: Unique identifier and session metadata.
- Processing Modules: Segmented into various categories such as optical physiology, fluorescence data, and image segmentation.
- ROI data: Includes dynamic table regions, pixel masks, and their corresponding indices.

Notable datasets within the NWB files include PlaneSegmentation data, specifying the outcomes of region-of-interest (ROI) identification, and RoiResponseSeries which contain fluorescence intensity measurements over time.
