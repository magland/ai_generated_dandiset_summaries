### Abstract

In this study, we investigate the modulation of neural interaction and response in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1HL) of rats through transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) stimulation. Using a 32-channel NeuroNexus® multi-electrode array, we performed local field potential (LFP) recordings in anesthetized rats subjected to peripheral electrical stimulation at the hindlimb. Recordings were obtained pre- and post-ultrasound application to analyze how tFUS influences the LFP waveforms elicited by electrical stimulation. Ultrasound was delivered in a pulsed pattern at five different sonication repetition frequencies (10 Hz, 50 Hz, 75 Hz, 100 Hz, and 125 Hz) to assess frequency-dependent plasticity mechanisms similar to those induced by tetanic electrical stimulation.

Our findings aim to determine whether tFUS can alter connectivity and correlation between targeted neurons, thereby modulating collective neural responses. The experimental protocol included a fundamental ultrasound frequency of 0.5 MHz, a pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of 3 kHz, and a total duty cycle of 36%. This data-driven approach offers insights into the potential therapeutic applications of tFUS in modulating neural circuits and improving neural plasticity. The recorded dataset comprises comprehensive LFP recordings across 32 channels, with detailed recordings during ultrasound application, rest periods, and during pre- and post-ultrasound electrical stimulation sessions.
