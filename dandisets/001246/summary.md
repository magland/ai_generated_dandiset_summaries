## Abstract

Phase Sensitive Optical Coherence Tomography (PSOCT) is a powerful imaging technique utilized for capturing high-resolution images of biological tissues. The dataset entitled "Phase Sensitive Optical Coherence Tomography Local Axis Orientation" is likely dedicated to exploring the imaging contrasts provided by PSOCT, specifically intensity, retardance, and orientation. These contrasts enable detailed structural and functional assessments of tissues, which could significantly enhance the understanding of tissue microstructures. This investigation possibly aims to augment existing optical coherence tomography methods by leveraging phase sensitivity to extract additional contrast mechanisms, potentially advancing both diagnostic imaging and research applications in biomedical fields.

While the primary focus of the experiment is elucidating optical properties through different contrast mechanisms, the dataset's broader purpose might encompass improving imaging protocols and analysis algorithms for enhanced identification of tissue composition and structure. Such advancements could propel forward clinical diagnostics, particularly for conditions where tissue orientation and microstructural integrity are of clinical relevance. Additionally, the methods developed here could be adapted for various scientific inquiries, where detailed imaging data is critical.

## NWB File Data Description

Currently, there are no NWB files available within this Dandiset. Consequently, specific data content typically housed within such files—such as timestamps, session details, or specific experimental measures—is not provided. When NWB files are included, they often encapsulate intricate details regarding experimental protocols, raw and processed data, and metadata describing the experimental context.
