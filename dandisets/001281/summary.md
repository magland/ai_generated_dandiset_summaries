The investigation into the electrophysiological and morphological properties of human cortical supragranular pyramidal cells aims to elucidate age-related characteristics of neural circuitry. Using a broad range of human life stages, this study employs whole-cell patch-clamp recordings to analyze the activities of Layer 2/3 pyramidal cells within the human neocortex. Conducted by the Gabor Tamas Lab, part of the ELKH-SZTE Research Group for Cortical Microcircuits at the University of Szeged, Hungary, the study is structured to provide deeper insights into the developmental trajectories of neuron functionality across different ages.

The experimental setup detailed involves current-clamp techniques to capture variations in voltage across neurons, instrumentalized using a HEKA EPC 10 USB amplifier with a 10 kHz Bessel filter. This specific configuration allows for acute precision in detecting neural responses to various stimuli, a critical component for understanding the intrinsic properties and potential age-dependent plasticity of the pyramidal cells. This research not only augments our foundational knowledge on human neuronal functionality but also could potentially inform broader neurological studies and applications in medical sciences.

The NWB files encapsulate extensive datasets derived from current clamp assays of electrical potential (Vm) and responses to structured stimulus presentations. For instance, each NWB file includes multiple CurrentClampSeries and IntracellularElectrode groups detailing specific voltages recorded through patch-clamp methods. Additionally, the datasets provide a comprehensive view of response profiles across different neurons and experimental conditions, summarizing sweeps to identify patterns and anomalies. The dataset is archived according to the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) data standard, allowing ease of access and reproducibility for future analyses.
