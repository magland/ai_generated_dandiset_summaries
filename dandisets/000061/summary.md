## Abstract

The consolidation of context-dependent emotional memory necessitates effective communication between the hippocampus and the basolateral amygdala (BLA), but the precise mechanisms underpinning this process remain elusive. This study investigated these mechanisms by recording neuronal ensembles in the hippocampus and BLA of rats as they learned to associate the location of an aversive air puff with specific sections of a linear track. Recordings were also taken during pre- and post-training sleep sessions to identify any reactivation patterns in neuronal activity.

The results revealed that coordinated reactivations were present between the hippocampus and BLA during non-REM sleep after training, peaking specifically during hippocampal sharp wave-ripples (SPW-Rs). A notable finding was that a subset of BLA cells showed increased modulation during these SPW-R events. Interestingly, the strength of reactivation was greater for hippocampus-BLA correlation patterns corresponding to the air puff direction compared to the 'safe' direction on the track. These findings suggest a mechanism for the consolidation of contextual emotional memory involving the ripple-reactivation of hippocampus-amygdala circuits during sleep.

## NWB File Data Description

The NWB files include comprehensive details of the experiments:
- **Raw Acquisition Data**: Electrical traces captured during the experiments.
- **Neuronal Data**: Information about spike times, cell types, and electrode groups for the recorded units.
- **Local Field Potentials (LFP)**: Intermediate data and processed electrical signals within the hippocampus and BLA.
- **Behavioral Data**: Include rat behavioral states, particularly focusing on sleep states and related epochs.
- **Video Data**: Video recordings documenting the rat's activity on the linear track during different sessions (pre-run, run, post-run).
- **Stimulus Events**: Annotations for stimulus presentations such as air puff and reward events, along with detected hippocampal ripples.

The datasets contain extensive metadata about the electrode setups, acquisition specifics, and processing techniques used, providing a clear and detailed picture of the experimental environment and methodologies.
