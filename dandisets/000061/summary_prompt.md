Below is an auto-generated summary of the contents of a Dandiset. It includes both metadata and a summary of the contents of the NWB files.

Please summarize the experiment in two or three paragraphs in the style of a scientific abstract touching on the likely purpose of the experiment.

Then give a description of what data are available in the NWB files.

Finally provide a list of up to ten keywords.

You should not refer to "Type X" since these are just internal labels used for communicating the breakdown of NWB files.

The summaries are from representative NWB files for each type, so keep that in mind when making your description. So for example, the timestamp or session ID is not going to be representative of all NWB files of that type.

Please provide your response in raw markdown suitable for copy/paste into a .md document.

description: The consolidation of context-dependent emotional memory requires communication between the hippocampus and the basolateral amygdala (BLA), but the mechanisms of this process are unknown. We recorded neuronal ensembles in the hippocampus and BLA while rats learned the location of an aversive air puff on a linear track, as well as during sleep before and after training. We found coordinated reactivations between the hippocampus and the BLA during non-REM sleep following training. These reactivations peaked during hippocampal sharp wave–ripples (SPW-Rs) and involved a subgroup of BLA cells positively modulated during hippocampal SPW-Rs. Notably, reactivation was stronger for the hippocampus–BLA correlation patterns representing the run direction that involved the air puff than for the 'safe' direction. These findings suggest that consolidation of contextual emotional memory occurs during ripple-reactivation of hippocampus–amygdala circuits.

  session_description: The consolidation of context-dependent emotional memory requires communication between the hippocampusand the basolateral amygdala (BLA), but the mechanisms of this process are unknown. We recorded neuronalensembles in the hippocampus and BLA while rats learned the location of an aversive air puff on a lineartrack, as well as during sleep before and after training. We found coordinated reactivations between thehippocampus and the BLA during non-REM sleep following training. These reactivations peaked duringhippocampal sharp wave-ripples (SPW-Rs) and involved a subgroup of BLA cells positively modulated duringhippocampal SPW-Rs. Notably, reactivation was stronger for the hippocampus-BLA correlation patternsrepresenting the run direction that involved the air puff than for the 'safe' direction. These findingssuggest that consolidation of contextual emotional memory occurs during ripple-reactivation ofhippocampus-amygdala circuits.

  session_description: The consolidation of context-dependent emotional memory requires communication between the hippocampusand the basolateral amygdala (BLA), but the mechanisms of this process are unknown. We recorded neuronalensembles in the hippocampus and BLA while rats learned the location of an aversive air puff on a lineartrack, as well as during sleep before and after training. We found coordinated reactivations between thehippocampus and the BLA during non-REM sleep following training. These reactivations peaked duringhippocampal sharp wave-ripples (SPW-Rs) and involved a subgroup of BLA cells positively modulated duringhippocampal SPW-Rs. Notably, reactivation was stronger for the hippocampus-BLA correlation patternsrepresenting the run direction that involved the air puff than for the 'safe' direction. These findingssuggest that consolidation of contextual emotional memory occurs during ripple-reactivation ofhippocampus-amygdala circuits.

  session_description: The consolidation of context-dependent emotional memory requires communication between the hippocampusand the basolateral amygdala (BLA), but the mechanisms of this process are unknown. We recorded neuronalensembles in the hippocampus and BLA while rats learned the location of an aversive air puff on a lineartrack, as well as during sleep before and after training. We found coordinated reactivations between thehippocampus and the BLA during non-REM sleep following training. These reactivations peaked duringhippocampal sharp wave-ripples (SPW-Rs) and involved a subgroup of BLA cells positively modulated duringhippocampal SPW-Rs. Notably, reactivation was stronger for the hippocampus-BLA correlation patternsrepresenting the run direction that involved the air puff than for the 'safe' direction. These findingssuggest that consolidation of contextual emotional memory occurs during ripple-reactivation ofhippocampus-amygdala circuits.

  session_description: The consolidation of context-dependent emotional memory requires communication between the hippocampusand the basolateral amygdala (BLA), but the mechanisms of this process are unknown. We recorded neuronalensembles in the hippocampus and BLA while rats learned the location of an aversive air puff on a lineartrack, as well as during sleep before and after training. We found coordinated reactivations between thehippocampus and the BLA during non-REM sleep following training. These reactivations peaked duringhippocampal sharp wave-ripples (SPW-Rs) and involved a subgroup of BLA cells positively modulated duringhippocampal SPW-Rs. Notably, reactivation was stronger for the hippocampus-BLA correlation patternsrepresenting the run direction that involved the air puff than for the 'safe' direction. These findingssuggest that consolidation of contextual emotional memory occurs during ripple-reactivation ofhippocampus-amygdala circuits.
