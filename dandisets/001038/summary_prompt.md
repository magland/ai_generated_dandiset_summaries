Below is an auto-generated summary of the contents of a Dandiset. It includes both metadata and a summary of the contents of the NWB files.

Please summarize the experiment in two or three paragraphs in the style of a scientific abstract touching on the likely purpose of the experiment.

Then give a description of what data are available in the NWB files.

Finally provide a list of up to ten keywords.

You should not refer to "Type X" since these are just internal labels used for communicating the breakdown of NWB files.

The summaries are from representative NWB files for each type, so keep that in mind when making your description. So for example, the timestamp or session ID is not going to be representative of all NWB files of that type.

Please provide your response in raw markdown suitable for copy/paste into a .md document.

description: Dopamine neurons are characterized by their response to unexpected rewards, but they also fire during movement and aversive stimuli. Dopamine neuron diversity has been observed based on molecular expression profiles; however, whether different functions map onto such genetic subtypes remains unclear. In this study, we established that three genetic dopamine neuron subtypes within the substantia nigra pars compacta, characterized by the expression of Slc17a6 (Vglut2), Calb1 and Anxa1, each have a unique set of responses to rewards, aversive stimuli and accelerations and decelerations, and these signaling patterns are highly correlated between somas and axons within subtypes. Remarkably, reward responses were almost entirely absent in the Anxa1+ subtype, which instead displayed acceleration-correlated signaling. Our findings establish a connection between functional and genetic dopamine neuron subtypes and demonstrate that molecular expression patterns can serve as a common framework to dissect dopaminergic functions.

  pharmacology: Adult mice (postnatal 2–4 months old) were anesthetized with isoflurane (1–2%), and a 0.5–1-mm-diameter craniotomy
  was made over the right substantia nigra (−3.25 mm caudal, +1.55 mm lateral from bregma).
  A small volume (0.4 μl total) of virus (AAV8-EF1α-CreOn/FlpOn-GCaMP6f (RRID:Addgene_137122, titer 6.10 × 1013)
  for Aldh1a1-iCre/Th-Flpo, Vglut2-IRES-Cre/Th-Flpo and Calb1-IRES2-Cre/Th-Flpo mice or AAV1-CAG-FLEX-GCaMP6f
  (RRID:Addgene_100835, titer 2.00 × 1013) for DAT-Cre or Anxa1-iCre mice), diluted 1:1 in PBS, was pressure injected
  through a pulled glass micropipette into the SNc at four depths (−3.8, −4.1, −4.4 and −4.7 mm ventral from dura
  surface, 0.1 μl per depth). After the injections, the skull and craniotomy were sealed with Metabond (Parkell),
  and a custom metal headplate was installed for head fixation. The location of recording sites was marked on the
  surface of the Metabond for future access. For Calb1-IRES2-Cre/DAT-tTA/Ai93D mice, which express GCaMP6f
  endogenously, no injection was conducted, and only the headplate was implanted at this time. Four weeks were
  allowed for GCaMP6f expression to ramp up and fill dopaminergic somas in SNc and axons in striatum.

  A small volume (0.4 μl total) of virus (AAV8-EF1α-CreOn/FlpOn-GCaMP6f (RRID:Addgene_137122, titer 6.10 × 1013)
  for Aldh1a1-iCre/Th-Flpo, Vglut2-IRES-Cre/Th-Flpo and Calb1-IRES2-Cre/Th-Flpo mice or AAV1-CAG-FLEX-GCaMP6f
  (RRID:Addgene_100835, titer 2.00 × 1013) for DAT-Cre or Anxa1-iCre mice), diluted 1:1 in PBS, was pressure injected
  through a pulled glass micropipette into the SNc at four depths (−3.8, −4.1, −4.4 and −4.7 mm ventral from dura
  surface, 0.1 μl per depth). After the injections, the skull and craniotomy were sealed with Metabond (Parkell),
  and a custom metal headplate was installed for head fixation. The location of recording sites was marked on the
  surface of the Metabond for future access. For Calb1-IRES2-Cre/DAT-tTA/Ai93D mice, which express GCaMP6f
  endogenously, no injection was conducted, and only the headplate was implanted at this time. Four weeks were
  allowed for GCaMP6f expression to ramp up and fill dopaminergic somas in SNc and axons in striatum.

  experiment_description: Dopamine neurons are characterized by their response to unexpected rewards, but they also fire during movement and
  aversive stimuli. Dopamine neuron diversity has been observed based on molecular expression profiles; however,
  whether different functions map onto such genetic subtypes remains unclear. In this study, we established that
  three genetic dopamine neuron subtypes within the substantia nigra pars compacta, characterized by the expression
  of Slc17a6 (Vglut2), Calb1 and Anxa1, each have a unique set of responses to rewards, aversive stimuli and
  accelerations and decelerations, and these signaling patterns are highly correlated between somas and axons within
  subtypes. Remarkably, reward responses were almost entirely absent in the Anxa1+ subtype, which instead displayed
  acceleration-correlated signaling. Our findings establish a connection between functional and genetic dopamine
  neuron subtypes and demonstrate that molecular expression patterns can serve as a common framework to dissect
  dopaminergic functions.

  experiment_description: Dopamine neurons are characterized by their response to unexpected rewards, but they also fire during movement and
  aversive stimuli. Dopamine neuron diversity has been observed based on molecular expression profiles; however,
  whether different functions map onto such genetic subtypes remains unclear. In this study, we established that
  three genetic dopamine neuron subtypes within the substantia nigra pars compacta, characterized by the expression
  of Slc17a6 (Vglut2), Calb1 and Anxa1, each have a unique set of responses to rewards, aversive stimuli and
  accelerations and decelerations, and these signaling patterns are highly correlated between somas and axons within
  subtypes. Remarkably, reward responses were almost entirely absent in the Anxa1+ subtype, which instead displayed
  acceleration-correlated signaling. Our findings establish a connection between functional and genetic dopamine
  neuron subtypes and demonstrate that molecular expression patterns can serve as a common framework to dissect
  dopaminergic functions.

  pharmacology: Adult mice (postnatal 2–4 months old) were anesthetized with isoflurane (1–2%), and a 0.5–1-mm-diameter craniotomy
  was made over the right substantia nigra (−3.25 mm caudal, +1.55 mm lateral from bregma).
  A small volume (0.4 μl total) of virus (AAV8-EF1α-CreOn/FlpOn-GCaMP6f (RRID:Addgene_137122, titer 6.10 × 1013)
  for Aldh1a1-iCre/Th-Flpo, Vglut2-IRES-Cre/Th-Flpo and Calb1-IRES2-Cre/Th-Flpo mice or AAV1-CAG-FLEX-GCaMP6f
  (RRID:Addgene_100835, titer 2.00 × 1013) for DAT-Cre or Anxa1-iCre mice), diluted 1:1 in PBS, was pressure injected
  through a pulled glass micropipette into the SNc at four depths (−3.8, −4.1, −4.4 and −4.7 mm ventral from dura
  surface, 0.1 μl per depth). After the injections, the skull and craniotomy were sealed with Metabond (Parkell),
  and a custom metal headplate was installed for head fixation. The location of recording sites was marked on the
  surface of the Metabond for future access. For Calb1-IRES2-Cre/DAT-tTA/Ai93D mice, which express GCaMP6f
  endogenously, no injection was conducted, and only the headplate was implanted at this time. Four weeks were
  allowed for GCaMP6f expression to ramp up and fill dopaminergic somas in SNc and axons in striatum.
