## Abstract

Dopamine neurons are known for their response to unexpected rewards, but they also exhibit activity during movement and aversive stimuli. While diversity among dopamine neurons has been noted based on molecular expression profiles, whether distinct functions correspond to these genetic subtypes remains uncertain. This study aimed to bridge this gap by examining three genetic subtypes of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, characterized by the expression of Slc17a6 (Vglut2), Calb1, and Anxa1. Each subtype showed unique responses to rewards, aversive stimuli, and accelerations and decelerations, with signaling patterns highly correlated between somas and axons within the same subtype. Remarkably, reward responses were almost entirely absent in the Anxa1+ subtype, which instead displayed acceleration-correlated signaling. These findings highlight the link between functional and genetic dopamine neuron subtypes and suggest that molecular expression patterns can serve as a framework for dissecting dopaminergic functions.

## Data Description

The Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files provide a comprehensive dataset that includes fiber photometry recordings of GCaMP6f fluorescence responses collected during 405 nm and 470 nm illumination. These recordings were obtained from head-fixed mice running on a treadmill while receiving rewards and aversive air puffs. Data includes raw fluorescence traces, processed dF/F traces calculated from the green fluorescence, and velocity and acceleration measurements from a rotary encoder collected at 4000 Hz. Additional data in the files includes metadata about the fiber photometry experiment, such as fiber placement coordinates, baseline and normalized fluorescence values, and the signal-to-noise ratio of the recordings. Event data, including TTL pulses, onset times of large fluorescence peaks, and the type and times of wheel events, are also included.
