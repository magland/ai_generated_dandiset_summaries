# Experiment Summary

Maternal care by non-biological parents is critical for the survival of offspring. Oxytocin, released by the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), plays a vital role in enabling neuroplasticity in the auditory cortex for maternal recognition of pup distress in mice. However, the mechanisms by which initial parental experience promotes hypothalamic signaling and cortical plasticity for consistent maternal care remain unclear. This study investigates the social transmission of maternal behavior in female virgin mice co-housed with an experienced mother and her litter. Continuous behavioral monitoring, coupled with neural recordings from the PVN, reveals that virgin mice engaged in maternal care under the guidance of experienced mothers, who demonstrated pup retrieval. Activation of PVN oxytocin neurons in these virgins induced alloparenting behaviors, suggesting that maternal behavior can be acquired through social transmission mediated by oxytocin signaling.

# Available Data in NWB Files

The dataset includes 28 Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files categorized into five types. The files contain a variety of data, including:
- **Type 1 and Type 2 NWB Files**: These files include fiber photometry data with detailed metadata about excitation sources, fibers, fluorophores, and photodetectors. Behavioral events related to pup states are also recorded.
- **Type 3 and Type 4 NWB Files**: These files encompass extracellular electrophysiological recordings. Each file describes electrodes, electrode groups, and sessions. Behavioral events are synced with the electrical recordings, capturing different behavioral states.
- **Type 5 NWB File**: This file contains multiple ElectricalSeries acquisition traces and extensive metadata on extracellular electrodes. It is also associated with behavioral events and session descriptions, focusing on video recording suites.
