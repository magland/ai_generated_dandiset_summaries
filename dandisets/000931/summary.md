### Abstract
This study investigates the role of mechanosensory feedback in the olfactory cortex, particularly focusing on how it uncouples external and self-generated sensory responses. Using Mus musculus (house mouse) as the model organism, the research employs electrophysiological approaches to measure neural activity. The uncoupling mechanism elucidated here could have significant implications for understanding sensory integration and modulation in the brain's olfactory system. The findings contribute to the broader knowledge on how different sensory modalities interact within the cortical regions to develop coherent sensory perceptions. The aim is to explore mechanosensory influences on olfactory processing, which may pave the way for new insights into sensory feedback systems.

### Available Data
The dataset includes one NWB file containing key experimental data. This file documents the electrophysiological measurements involving spike-sorting techniques. Specifically, the file (session_id: 1) from 2021 includes data on spike amplitudes, contamination percentages of units, spike times, and qualities of recorded neural units. Moreover, various attributes such as unit depths, channels, frequencies, and original cluster identities are provided. The dataset is highly detailed, offering a comprehensive insight into the neural recordings and their respective temporal occurrences.
