### Scientific Abstract

Hippocampal theta oscillations are fundamental in coordinating neuronal firing for the support of memory and spatial navigation. The medial septum (MS) plays a pivotal role in theta generation either by imposing a unitary pacemaker signal across the hippocampal system or by organizing subcircuits within the phase space of theta oscillations. This study investigates the role of the MS in theta synchronization by leveraging temperature manipulation. Cooling the MS led to reductions in both theta frequency and power, increased mistakes during spatial navigation tasks, and disrupted temporal but not spatial correlates of hippocampal neuron activities.

Specifically, MS cooling decreased the frequency of theta oscillations in place cells and attenuated distance-time compression while maintaining distance-phase compression within theta cycles. These results elucidate that the medial septum is essential for the preservation of precise theta phase coordination between hippocampal cell assemblies, a mechanism crucial for spatial memory consolidation. The findings indicate that hippocampal cell assemblies are organized by theta phase rather than by clock time, underscoring the importance of septal input in spatial memory processes.

### NWB File Data Description

The Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files encompass detailed electrophysiological recordings and behavioral data from five Norway rats. The recordings include raw acquisition traces, processed local field potentials (LFPs), and metadata related to electrodes. Multi-shank 64-site silicon probes were bilaterally implanted in the CA1 pyramidal layer of the dorsal hippocampus. Each NWB file documents experimental trials, with trial conditions such as maze direction and cooling state, alongside behavioral metrics like subject position, speed, and acceleration through the maze. Additionally, the data feature internal brain temperature recordings and spike times for individual units, classified by quality.

The datasets provide comprehensive metadata, including electrode groups, filtering protocols, locations, and impedance values. Specifically, the files detail the position and movement of the subjects during experimental tasks, capturing precise (x, y, z) coordinates, speeds, and acceleration data within the maze environment. Intermediate data processing modules encapsulate information on the extracellular electrophysiology recordings, focusing on LFP signals pertinent to theta oscillations.
