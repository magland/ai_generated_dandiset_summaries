### Abstract

The study investigates the role of decreased PGC-1α levels in promoting the chronification of pain, particularly in the context of aging. The experiment utilized a mouse model to explore how alterations in the expression of PGC-1α, a transcriptional coactivator, influence pain perception and its transition to chronic pain states. The research aims to provide insights into the molecular mechanisms that underpin chronic pain, which is a significant health concern in the elderly population. Enhancing our understanding of PGC-1α's role may uncover potential therapeutic targets for alleviating chronic pain and improving quality of life in aging individuals.

To explore this, two-photon microscopy was employed to conduct calcium imaging in the hippocampal neurons of mice to observe activity changes associated with PGC-1α expression. Additionally, mechanical allodynia responses were measured across various conditions to assess behavioral pain responses correlated to different PGC-1α genotypes and sex. These experiments collectively seek to delineate the effects of altered PGC-1α levels on neural activity and pain perception.

### NWB File Data Description

The NWB files contain comprehensive datasets across multiple experimental setups. The first set of files includes raw calcium imaging data collected using two-photon microscopy, providing detailed observations of neuronal activity in response to PGC-1α variations. The second and third sets capture time-series data on mechanical allodynia responses with details on the genotypes (PGC1a +/- and PGC1a +/+) and conditions (CCI vs. Sham, including sex differences) to evaluate behavioral manifestations of pain. The fourth and fifth sets include single-channel fluorescence images captured in blue and green channels, providing additional cellular-level insights into changes associated with PGC-1α expression.
