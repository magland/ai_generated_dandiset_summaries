### Electrophysiological Dataset of the Human Amygdala During Aversive Dynamic Visual Stimulation

Nine epilepsy patients undergoing preoperative invasive monitoring in the mesial temporal lobe participated in an experiment involving visual dynamic stimulation of emotional aversive content. While viewing dynamic sequences of fearful faces (aversive condition) and neutral landscapes (neutral condition), simultaneous intracranial EEG (iEEG) and neuronal spike times were recorded from the amygdala. This investigation aimed to explore the amygdalar response to emotionally charged stimuli and how it contrasts with neutral stimuli. The dataset provides a rich resource for understanding neural responses to aversive stimuli at multiple scales, from macroscopic iEEG signals to single neuron activity.

The consisting dataset contains 17 NWB files including iEEG data and neuronal data that have been processed and validated for quality. Metadata related to subjects, sessions, and electrodes are also included. For each experiment session, the recorded data encompasses millisecond-precision measurements of local field potentials and spike waveforms. Tasks required patients to view blocks of short video clips featuring either fearful faces or neutral landscapes, ensuring that emotional responses were systematically triggered and recorded. This dataset is complemented by metadata that specifies task parameters, electrode configurations, and spike-sorting quality metrics.

### Available Data in NWB Files

- **Type 1 NWB Files**: Include videos of both aversive and neutral stimuli, iEEG data, metadata about electrodes, device information, and trial intervals with timestamps. It also consists of metadata such as electrode positions and references, session details, and units with spike times and waveforms.
- **Type 2 NWB Files**: Similar to Type 1, and additionally include processed extracellular electrophysiology data, particularly local field potentials (LFP).
- **Type 3 NWB Files**: Focus on single electrode data, including videos of dynamic stimuli, iEEG recordings for one electrode, and detailed electrode metadata.
- **Type 4 NWB Files**: Include metadata and electrophysiological data for single electrode channels, similar in structure to Type 3.
- **Type 5 NWB Files**: Analogous to Types 1-4 but pertain to recordings from different experimental sessions, containing videos, iEEG data, and associated metadata for two electrodes.
