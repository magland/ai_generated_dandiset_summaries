## Scientific Abstract

To advance our understanding of neural circuitry and signal propagation, this study presents a comprehensive dataset of simultaneously recorded fluorescence signals and spiking activity from pyramidal neurons in layer 2/3 of the primary visual cortex of transgenic mice. These mice express genetically-encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) GCaMP6s or GCaMP6f, enabling the concurrent capture of calcium dynamics and electrical activity. The data provide valuable insights into the synchronous behaviors of neuronal populations, elucidating the coupling between calcium transients and neuronal spikes.

The primary aim of this experiment is to bridge the gap between optical imaging techniques and electrophysiological measurements, thereby offering a multi-modal perspective on neuronal function in vivo. The dataset was meticulously recorded using two-photon calcium imaging alongside targeted cell-attached electrophysiological recordings, revealing the intricate spatial and temporal patterns of neural activity. This integrative approach contributes towards creating a holistic narrative of how neurons process and convey information within cortical circuits.
