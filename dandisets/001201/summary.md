### Abstract

This study investigates the long-term stability of intracortical neural recordings and the decoding of neural signals for motor control by employing an extensive dataset of neural and kinematic data from a Rhesus monkey. The experimental paradigm involved a self-paced finger movement task executed over six sessions spanning a period of 2.5 years. A Utah microelectrode array implanted in the motor cortex (M1) was used to record multiunit threshold crossings and spiking band power across 96 channels. The macaque was tasked with moving two finger groups to acquire visual targets on a screen, capturing both positions and velocities of the index finger and the group comprising the middle, ring, and small fingers.

Each experimental session comprised 750 trials, evenly split between center-out (CO) and random (RD) target styles. CO trials involved alternating trials between specified non-center targets and a center location, while RD trials required randomization in target positions for each finger group. This design aimed to assess the neural decoders' robustness against temporal variability, effectively contributing to improved prosthetic device design and stable neural decoding solutions over extended timelines.

### NWB Files Description

The NWB files contain comprehensive metainformation and data regarding the electrophysiological recordings and behavioral outputs during the macaque's finger movement tasks. Key components include metadata on the electrode configurations, with specifics about channel filtering and locations, processed behavioral time series data representing finger positions and velocities, as well as neural data processed into binned spikes and spiking band power. The experiment's trials are well-documented within these files, featuring trial timestamps, target positions, and styles, along with references to the corresponding time series data.
