## Abstract

This study investigates the temporal dynamics of transmembrane potential (TMP) at the cathode- and anode-facing poles of a cell, induced by a train of five pulses at 833 kHz. Using strobe imaging synchronized with nanosecond electric pulse (nsEP) exposure, this research aims to elucidate the relationship between electroporation efficiency and changes in TMP. The experiment involved pulsed laser fluorescence microscopy with voltage-sensitive FluoVolt dye-loaded cells that can respond to TMP changes within nanoseconds. The dyeâ€™s high sensitivity (approximately 10% deltaF/F per 100 mV) enables precise measurements of TMP kinetics during and after nsEP exposure.

The methodology employed pulsed laser fluorescence, with a single short pulse delivered at precise 25 ns intervals relative to the nsEP. The camera shutter timing was optimized to capture one TMP image per nsEP exposure, allowing detailed temporal mapping. Results could significantly enhance the understanding of TMP charging and relaxation behaviors, crucial for optimizing electroporation efficiency. This study was supported by NIH grant 1R21EY034258.

## Data Available in NWB Files

The Dandiset contains 18 NWB files, each representing a separate recording session. Each NWB file includes image series data acquired by strobe imaging, detailing the TMP changes in cells loaded with the FluoVolt dye under nsEP exposure. The dataset captures TMP responses synchronized with laser flashes at incremental time intervals of 25 ns. Metadata within the NWB files provide details such as session identifiers, specific experimental conditions (e.g., pulse shape and duration, electric field settings), and cell line information. The files were created under the stewardship of the Pakhomov Lab at Old Dominion University, with Iurii Semenov as the experimenter.
