# Multimodal Analysis of Brain Responses During Movie Watching in Epileptic Patients

This study presents a comprehensive multimodal dataset capturing intracranial recordings, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), and eye tracking data from 20 participants with intractable epilepsy as they watched an 8-minute excerpt from the movie "Bang! You're Dead." The dataset, acquired to monitor epileptic seizures, encompasses recordings from single neurons, local field potentials, and intracranial EEG activities via depth electrodes targeting the amygdala, hippocampus, and medial frontal cortex. Additionally, participants performed a recognition memory test for the movie content. In 11 participants, 3T fMRI activity was recorded before surgery while performing the same task. This dataset aims to facilitate a wide range of neuroscientific investigations, including brain activity during movie watching, recognition memory processes, and the neural basis of the fMRI-BOLD signal in humans.

For technical validation, the dataset comes with signal quality metrics, assessments of eye tracking data, behavioral responses, cellular tuning, and high-frequency broadband power field potentials related to familiarity and event boundaries. Also included are brain-wide inter-subject correlations derived from fMRI data. The NWB- and BIDS-formatted dataset comprises spike times, field potential activity, behavioral responses, eye tracking, electrode locations, demographic information, and comprehensive functional and structural MRI scans.

## NWB Files Data Description

The dataset contains 25 Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files distributed across five main types, documenting various experimental sessions. Key contents from these files include:
- TTL marker events and experiment IDs corresponding to movie watching and recognition trials.
- Comprehensive metadata about extracellular electrodes, including their locations, IDs, and group affiliations.
- Local field potentials (LFP) recorded from macro and micro electrodes.
- Behavioral data including blink duration, eye tracking (gaze points), fixation duration and location, pupil size, and saccade details.
- Detailed information on experimental trials covering button presses, response confidence levels, correctness, response time, and stimulus details.
- Processed extracellular electrophysiology data, including units' spike times, mean waveforms for encoding and recognition phases, and signal-to-noise ratios (SNR).
