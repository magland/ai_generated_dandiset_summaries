## Experiment Summary

This study presents detailed electrophysiological data collected from thirteen human subjects during a visual working memory task. The participants, comprising epilepsy patients undergoing intracranial monitoring for seizure localization, were required to perform a visual change detection task. During this task, arrays of colored squares varying in number (1, 2, 4, or 6) were presented, which the subjects needed to memorize. After a retention interval, a test array was displayed, and subjects were asked to indicate whether it was identical to or differed from the initial array. The task featured 192 trials per session, incorporating a sequence of visual and retention phases, followed by a response window. Pre-training sessions ensured comprehension and task preparedness.

The experiment aimed to investigate the neuronal mechanisms underpinning visual working memory by recording single-unit firing activity within the medial temporal lobe. The subjects were equipped with intracranial electrodes, and electrophysiological signals were captured as they responded to the visual stimuli. The study's design provides insights into how neural circuits in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex facilitate working memory processes, leveraging both behavioral and electrophysiological data to enrich our understanding of cognitive functions in human participants.

## Data Description

The NWB files in this dataset contain comprehensive electrophysiological and behavioral data. Key elements include detailed metadata about the experimental setup and electrodes, single-unit spike times, and local field potential (LFP) recordings. The files document the locations of electrodes, their corresponding x, y, and z coordinates, and their classification relevant to the seizure onset zone. Behavioral data capture the participants' responses and trial intervals, while processing modules provide insights into the LFP and spike sorting data. Data for each trial specify the set size and the correct solution (same or different) regarding the test array. The files also include timestamps for various experimental epochs and relevant electrode groups.
