### Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) Study on Microelectrode Arrays

In this study, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data is collected from multichannel microelectrode arrays coated with activated iridium oxide (AIROF), sputtered iridium oxide (SIROF), or ruthenium oxide (RuOx). The aim of this experiment is to evaluate the impedance characteristics of different electrode coatings, which are crucial for enhancing the performance and efficacy of neural interfaces. By systematically analyzing the impedance profiles, the researchers seek to understand how different materials and fabrication techniques affect the electrical properties of electrodes. This knowledge can inform the design of more efficient and lower impedance electrodes for neuroprosthetic devices.

All experiments were conducted in vitro, with electrodes immersed in an electrolyte solution to simulate physiological conditions. Electrode arrays were subjected to a potentiostatic EIS experiment, where impedance was measured over a range of frequencies. This approach allows for the characterization of both the resistive and capacitive components of the electrode-electrolyte interface. The data gathered includes frequency, real impedance (Z-real), and imaginary impedance (Z-imaginary) values. This comprehensive dataset can be utilized to fit equivalent circuit models and assess the long-term stability and performance of the electrode coatings.

### Available Data in NWB Files

The dataset consists of 100 NWB files, each capturing different aspects of the EIS experiments. The main elements included are:

1. **Type 1 Files:** 
   - General information about devices used (GAMRY) and the electrodes.
   - Frequency, Z-real, and Z-imaginary data stored in a DynamicTable.
   - Metadata about the electrodes such as area, material, and location within the subject.
   - Sample session details and file creation dates.

2. **Type 2 Files:**
   - Similar in structure to type 1 but with a focus on AIROF coated electrodes.
   - Impedance data stored in DynamicTable format.
   - Additional metadata including institutional and lab affiliations.

3. **Type 3 Files:**
   - Similar in structure to type 1 and type 2 but focusing on RuOx coated electrodes.
   - Impedance data stored in the same structured format.
   - Detailed metadata including experimental setup descriptions and session data.
