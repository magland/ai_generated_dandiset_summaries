## Abstract

This study explores the neuronal response characteristics to transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) stimulation applied to the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) using a phased ultrasound array. Utilizing a 128-element array transducer, we implemented intracranial recordings with a 32-channel Soft NET Probe, which is integrated for compatibility with tFUS. The electrode, chronically implanted in anesthetized Wistar rats under isoflurane, facilitated repeated use over multiple sessions. Various parameters such as pulse repetition frequencies and pressure levels of the ultrasound were systematically varied every 2.5 seconds (Â±10%) to uncover the optimal conditions for neuronal response. Additionally, this study examines the efficacy of transducer setups with and without a collimator attached to optimize conditions for chronic recording and tFUS modulation.

In the context of 500 trials per recording, we focused on quantifying the spike times of neural signals and delineating the event times tied to each tFUS trial. The pulse duration remained constant at 67 milliseconds during stimulation delivery. Our comparative analysis between different transducer configurations sheds light on their respective influences on chronic recording viability. This study aims to extend the understanding of neural pathway interactions with focused ultrasound and optimize conditions for potential therapeutic or diagnostic applications leveraging tFUS technology.

## NWB Files Description

The available NWB files from the Dandiset encompass detailed records of neural spike times and stimulation event intervals during tFUS application. These files contain structured data from multiple channels, including electrode configurations, filtering parameters, and spatial positioning (x, y, z coordinates) for each electrode. The dataset provides comprehensive timestamps for trial initiation and cessation, alongside spike time distributions across identified units with relevant cell-type labels. Notably, the recorded sessions detail electrode device specifications, trial setups, and any incorporated collimators used during experimentations. This wealth of data supports in-depth analyses of neuronal activity within the context of ultrasound-induced modulation in the somatosensory cortex.
