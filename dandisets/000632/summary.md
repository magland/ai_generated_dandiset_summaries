## Electroporation Efficiency of Co-Directional and Cross-Directional Paired Pulses

The experiment aimed to evaluate the efficiency of electroporation in BPAE cell monolayers using co-directional and cross-directional paired pulses delivered through a triangular electrode array. Electroporation involved administering four paired pulses, each 600 nanoseconds long, at two distinct frequencies—1 Hz and 770 kHz—and an amplitude of 10 kV/cm. For co-directional pulses, the electric field direction remained constant throughout each pulse pair, while for cross-directional pulses, the field direction was varied by 90°. The success of electroporation was quantified by measuring the uptake of YoPro-1 dye, which serves as an indicator of cell membrane permeabilization under different electric field orientations and frequencies. This study was supported by NIH grant 1R21EY034258.

## Available Data in NWB Files

The dataset includes a total of 24 NWB files containing recorded data from the electroporation experiments. Each NWB file features images captured using an IX83 microscope equipped with an MS-2000 scanning stage and an ORCA-Flash4 sCMOS camera. The recordings involve 144 images taken in a 12x12 grid from a six-well plate as well as 216 additional images utilizing DAPI and FITC filter cubes, all of which were automatically stitched together to create a final composite. These high-resolution images were acquired using a 10×, 0.38NA objective. The dataset contains metadata about the experimental sessions, including the identifier, session description, session start time, and timestamps reference time.
