## Age affects odor-evoked calcium responses in the ant antennal lobe

Calcium imaging experiments were performed on the clonal raider ant antennal lobe to investigate how age influences odor coding. This study involved ants that were either two weeks old or two months old, corresponding to different behavioral roles—nurse-like and forager-like, respectively. The ants belonged to clonal line B with a specific transgene insert ([ie-DsRed, ObirOrco-QF2, 15xQUAS-GCaMP6s]), which labels all Orco-positive antennal lobe glomeruli, enabling the recording of odor responses throughout the antennal lobe using volumetric imaging. The study aims to shed light on age-related modifications in odor coding and the neural representation of pheromones in ants.

Ants were exposed to a set of odorants including general odorants (3-hexanone, isopropanol, ethanol, propionic acid, ethylpyrazine) and alarm pheromones (4-methyl-3-heptanone and 4-methyl-3-heptanol) at two different concentrations (3% and 48% volume/volume in paraffin oil). The calcium imaging data were recorded over a total of 48 seconds per trial, with a 3-second lag time followed by a 5-second odor stimulus. Imaging was performed at a rate of 0.83 volumes per second with 33 Z-planes for each volume. Experiments were conducted on various dates for both age groups to ensure robustness and reproducibility of the results.

### Data Available in the NWB Files
The dataset comprises 16 NWB files, each containing detailed records of the imaging experiments. Each file includes:
- **Two-photon recordings**: Capturing 40 cycles, with 48 seconds of total recording time.
- **Imaging Planes**: Information about the imaging planes at specific Z-depths (ranging from 0 µm to 110 µm).
- **Optical Channels**: Data from the Green PMT channels.
- **Device Info**: Specifications of the two-photon microscope used, which includes a Coherent Axon laser and dual GaAsP detectors.
- **Experiment Metadata**: Details such as the concentration and type of odorant used, Z-plane depths, and the timing of stimuli.
- **Sessions**: Each NWB file logs the precise session start times, session descriptions, and unique identifiers for reproducibility and reference.

These comprehensive data files support analyses of odor-evoked calcium responses at different depths of the antennal lobe, facilitating an in-depth understanding of the neural processes underlying odor coding in the clonal raider ant.
