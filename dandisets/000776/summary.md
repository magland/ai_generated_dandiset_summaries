### Experiment Summary

The dataset "Brain-wide representations of behavior spanning multiple timescales and states in C. elegans" involves the study of neural activity and behavior in the model organism **Caenorhabditis elegans**. Using advanced imaging techniques such as a spinning disk confocal system, this study aims to capture detailed neural dynamics across different timescales and behavioral states. The dataset comprises recordings from 38 individual worms, making it significant for understanding the relationship between neural activity and various types of behavior under different conditions.

Each experiment involves imaging the worms using various fluorophores including GCaMP for calcium imaging, mNeptune, and different fluorophores from the NeuroPAL toolkit. These methods enable high-resolution, cell-specific measurements of neural activity alongside behavioral data such as angular velocity, body curvature, and pumping rates. The experiments are designed to induce different stimuli, including heat, and observe the resulting changes in neural network dynamics and behavior.

### Data Available in NWB Files

The NWB files contain a comprehensive array of datasets including NIR bright-field images, GCaMP calcium imaging series, and NeuroPAL structural images. The metadata associated with these recordings includes the worm's behavior metrics, such as body and head curvature, forwardness, feedingness, dorsalness, and movement velocity. Additionally, detailed descriptions of the imaging volumes, devices, and channels used are provided.

In terms of neural data, the NWB files feature calcium time series, fluorescence signals, and segmented neuron coordinates identified using NeuroPAL. The datasets include voxel masks, time series data for behavioral epochs, and annotations for neuron ROI (Region of Interest) locations and IDs. Behavioral data is meticulously processed and includes event markers for specific behaviors such as reversal events and feeding.
