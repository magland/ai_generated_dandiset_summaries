## Abstract
This study investigates the behavioral responses of zebrafish, *Danio rerio*, to a thermal gradient ranging from 24°C to 32°C. Conducted within a controlled experimental environment at THE Ohio State University, the research aims to elucidate zebrafish preferences and avoidance patterns across this temperature spectrum. The behavioral setup involved positioning zebrafish within a gradient chamber monitored by high-speed tracking to capture subtle variations in movement and positioning, alongside adjustments in fish heading. This design facilitates the assessment of thermotactic behavior, offering insights into how thermal stimuli influence zebrafish positioning within distinct lanes of the chamber.

The experiment was carried out over a standardized session beginning on October 24, 2023. Data collection involved monitoring zebrafish navigation within lanes of a specifically designed gradient chamber, with emphasis placed on real-time tracking of the fish’s positional coordinates, heading orientation, and the immediate aquatic temperature. Underpinning this study is the hypothesis that zebrafish will demonstrate detectable directional preferences correlating with the thermal gradient conditions, potentially shedding light on thermal preference behavior that may have neurobiological correlates relevant to broader vertebrate models.

## NWB File Data Description
The Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files encapsulate an extensive dataset detailing the zebrafish behavior in a thermal gradient. Contained within each of the 17 files are records of fish positions within the swim lanes encoded in mm coordinates, compass direction readings in radians denoting fish heading, and the corresponding ambient temperature at specific fish positions. Each NWB file houses comprehensive BehavioralTimeSeries data supplemented by Processing Modules capturing the analytical workflow. Both left and right swim lanes are documented for consistent behavioral analysis.

Moreover, the files also encompass metadata including session descriptors, timestamps, device specifications, and precise experiment conditions. Critical metadata elements such as session start and end times, frame rate, and resolution parameters offer additional context to the numeric behavioral data. This structured data collection enables robust cross-comparative analysis across different experiment sessions and subjects, paving the way for further physiological and behavioral insights.
