# Offline Ensemble Co-reactivation Links Memories Across Days

Memories are stored in neural ensembles during learning, and their stabilization is attributed to post-learning reactivation. The efficient integration of recent experiences into existing memories ensures that memories reflect current information. However, the neural mechanisms underlying this integration remain elusive. The current study investigates how strong aversive experiences induce offline ensemble reactivation, thereby linking a recent aversive memory with a neutral memory formed two days earlier. Our experiments reveal that these co-reactivations occur more frequently during wakeful states than during sleep, suggesting that the brain actively relates temporally disparate memories through shared neural processes. These findings highlight offline ensemble co-reactivation as a pivotal mechanism for memory integration across days.

We utilized a mouse model to explore the specific linkage between fear and previously neutral memories. Through rigorous experimentation, including exposure to both neutral and aversive contexts, we examined whether fear retromodulates existing neutral memories. Our results confirm this hypothesis, showcasing that fear can retrospectively link to neutral memories from prior days, further indicated by shared ensemble reactivation patterns during subsequent contextual testing. These findings offer a nuanced view of memory consolidation, suggesting a greater neuronal complexity in memory representation and integration than previously understood.

## Available Data in NWB Files

The NWB files contain a rich dataset recorded from mice subjected to various experimental conditions using one-photon microscopy. These include imaging data of neural activity captured with Miniscopes, along with behavioral data such as freezing intervals that are carefully annotated. The dataset also comprises electrophysiological recordings such as EEG, EMG, and temperature signals, providing a multimodal perspective on brain activity during different memory-related tasks. Notably, cross-session cell registration and segmentation information allow for detailed analyses of specific ensembles involved in memory linking. Each data file captures specific sessions, covering both aversive and neutral contexts, with additional offline sessions devoted to understanding reactivation patterns.
