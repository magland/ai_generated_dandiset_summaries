Below is an auto-generated summary of the contents of a Dandiset. It includes both metadata and a summary of the contents of the NWB files.

Please summarize the experiment in two or three paragraphs in the style of a scientific abstract touching on the likely purpose of the experiment.

Then give a description of what data are available in the NWB files.

Finally provide a list of up to ten keywords.

You should not refer to "Type X" since these are just internal labels used for communicating the breakdown of NWB files.

The summaries are from representative NWB files for each type, so keep that in mind when making your description. So for example, the timestamp or session ID is not going to be representative of all NWB files of that type.

Please provide your response in raw markdown suitable for copy/paste into a .md document.

description: Memories are encoded in neural ensembles during learning and are stabilized by post-learning reactivation. Integrating recent experiences into existing memories ensures that memories contain the most recently available information, but how the brain accomplishes this critical process remains unclear. Here we show that in mice, a strong aversive experience drives offline ensemble reactivation of not only the recent aversive memory but also a neutral memory formed 2 days before, linking fear of the recent aversive memory to the previous neutral memory. Fear specifically links retrospectively, but not prospectively, to neutral memories across days. Consistent with previous studies, we find that the recent aversive memory ensemble is reactivated during the offline period after learning. However, a strong aversive experience also increases co-reactivation of the aversive and neutral memory ensembles during the offline period. Ensemble co-reactivation occurs more during wake than during sleep. Finally, the expression of fear in the neutral context is associated with reactivation of the shared ensemble between the aversive and neutral memories. Collectively, these results demonstrate that offline ensemble co-reactivation is a neural mechanism by which memories are integrated across days.

  experiment_description: Simultaneous calcium imaging with Miniscopes and EEG/EMG experiment during retrospective memory-linking behavioral paradigm, to test whether ensemble co-reactivation is sleep-state specific. Mice were exposed to the neutral context for 10 min to explore. During aversive encoding, after a baseline period of 2 min, mice received three 2 s foot shocks of either amplitude 0.25 mA (low-shock) or 1.5 mA (high-shock), with an intershock interval of 1 min. Then, 30 s after the final shock, the mice were removed and returned to the vivarium. On the next 3 days, the mice were tested in the previously experienced aversive and neutral contexts, as well as a completely novel context that they had not been exposed to previously, for 5 min each. The features of the neutral and novel contexts were counter-balanced and were made up of different olfactory, auditory, lighting and tactile cues. The aversive context was always the same with distinct cues from the neutral and novel contexts. In the low- versus high-shock experiments mice were tested in the aversive context first, followed by testing in the neutral and novel context counter-balanced; half of the mice received neutral recall and then novel-context exposure the next day, and the other half received novel-context exposure and then neutral recall.

  surgery: Mice were anaesthetized with 1 to 2% isoflurane for surgical procedures and placed into a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments). Eye ointment was applied to prevent desiccation, and the mice were kept on a heated pad to prevent hypothermia. Surgery was performed using aseptic technique. After surgery, carprofen (5mg per kg) was administered every day for the following 3 days, and ampicillin (20mg per kg) was administered every day for the next 7days. For calcium imaging experiments with EEG/EMG implants, mice underwent three serial procedures spaced around 2 weeks apart. During the first surgery, mice had 300 nl of AAV1-Syn-GCaMP6f injected into dorsal CA1 (AP, âˆ’2 mm; ML, +1.5 mm; DV, âˆ’1.2 mm), the incision was sutured after the surgery. Then, 2 weeks later during a second surgery, mice had their overlying cortex aspirated and a GRIN lens was implanted above the injection site. This involved aspirating the cortex with a 27-gauge blunt syringe needle attached to a vacuum pump, constantly irrigating with cortex buffer. When the striations of the corpus callosum were visible, a 30-gauge needle replaced the 27-gauge needle for finer-tuned aspiration. Once most of corpus callosum was removed, bleeding was controlled using surgical foam (Surgifoam), and a 1 mm diameter x 4 mm length GRIN lens (GRINTECH) was slowly lowered into the craniotomy. The lens was fixed with cyanoacrylate, and dental acrylic was applied to cement the implant in place and cover the exposed skull. The top of the exposed lens was covered with Kwik-Sil (World Precision Instruments) and then dental cement. During this same surgery, a wireless telemetry probe (HD-X02, Data Science International) was implanted with EEG and EMG wires. Two EMG wires were placed into the left trapezius muscle. One EEG wire was implanted between the skull and dura mater above the dorsal hippocampus on the contralateral hemisphere to the GRIN lens (left hemisphere; AP, âˆ’2 mm; ML, âˆ’1.5 mm), and a reference EEG wire was implanted between the skull and the dura on the right hemisphere overlying the prefrontal cortex (AP, +1.75 mm; ML, âˆ’0.5 mm). Cyanoacrylate and dental cement fixed the GRIN lens, anchor screw, and EEG wires in place. The telemetry probes were implanted during this second surgery to minimize the time mice needed to live with the implant. During the third procedure, the mice were returned to implant the baseplate. The Miniscope with an attached baseplate was lowered near the implanted lens, with the field of view monitored in real-time on a computer. The Miniscope was rotated until a well-exposed field of view was observed, at which point the baseplate was fixed to the implant with cyanoacrylate and dental cement.

  experiment_description: Simultaneous calcium imaging with Miniscopes and EEG/EMG experiment during retrospective memory-linking behavioral paradigm, to test whether ensemble co-reactivation is sleep-state specific. Mice were exposed to the neutral context for 10 min to explore. During aversive encoding, after a baseline period of 2 min, mice received three 2 s foot shocks of either amplitude 0.25 mA (low-shock) or 1.5 mA (high-shock), with an intershock interval of 1 min. Then, 30 s after the final shock, the mice were removed and returned to the vivarium. On the next 3 days, the mice were tested in the previously experienced aversive and neutral contexts, as well as a completely novel context that they had not been exposed to previously, for 5 min each. The features of the neutral and novel contexts were counter-balanced and were made up of different olfactory, auditory, lighting and tactile cues. The aversive context was always the same with distinct cues from the neutral and novel contexts. In the low- versus high-shock experiments mice were tested in the aversive context first, followed by testing in the neutral and novel context counter-balanced; half of the mice received neutral recall and then novel-context exposure the next day, and the other half received novel-context exposure and then neutral recall.

  surgery: Mice were anaesthetized with 1 to 2% isoflurane for surgical procedures and placed into a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments). Eye ointment was applied to prevent desiccation, and the mice were kept on a heated pad to prevent hypothermia. Surgery was performed using aseptic technique. After surgery, carprofen (5mg per kg) was administered every day for the following 3 days, and ampicillin (20mg per kg) was administered every day for the next 7days. For calcium imaging experiments with EEG/EMG implants, mice underwent three serial procedures spaced around 2 weeks apart. During the first surgery, mice had 300 nl of AAV1-Syn-GCaMP6f injected into dorsal CA1 (AP, âˆ’2 mm; ML, +1.5 mm; DV, âˆ’1.2 mm), the incision was sutured after the surgery. Then, 2 weeks later during a second surgery, mice had their overlying cortex aspirated and a GRIN lens was implanted above the injection site. This involved aspirating the cortex with a 27-gauge blunt syringe needle attached to a vacuum pump, constantly irrigating with cortex buffer. When the striations of the corpus callosum were visible, a 30-gauge needle replaced the 27-gauge needle for finer-tuned aspiration. Once most of corpus callosum was removed, bleeding was controlled using surgical foam (Surgifoam), and a 1 mm diameter x 4 mm length GRIN lens (GRINTECH) was slowly lowered into the craniotomy. The lens was fixed with cyanoacrylate, and dental acrylic was applied to cement the implant in place and cover the exposed skull. The top of the exposed lens was covered with Kwik-Sil (World Precision Instruments) and then dental cement. During this same surgery, a wireless telemetry probe (HD-X02, Data Science International) was implanted with EEG and EMG wires. Two EMG wires were placed into the left trapezius muscle. One EEG wire was implanted between the skull and dura mater above the dorsal hippocampus on the contralateral hemisphere to the GRIN lens (left hemisphere; AP, âˆ’2 mm; ML, âˆ’1.5 mm), and a reference EEG wire was implanted between the skull and the dura on the right hemisphere overlying the prefrontal cortex (AP, +1.75 mm; ML, âˆ’0.5 mm). Cyanoacrylate and dental cement fixed the GRIN lens, anchor screw, and EEG wires in place. The telemetry probes were implanted during this second surgery to minimize the time mice needed to live with the implant. During the third procedure, the mice were returned to implant the baseplate. The Miniscope with an attached baseplate was lowered near the implanted lens, with the field of view monitored in real-time on a computer. The Miniscope was rotated until a well-exposed field of view was observed, at which point the baseplate was fixed to the implant with cyanoacrylate and dental cement.

  Group /processing/cell_registration (ProcessingModule) Processing module for cross session cell registration. Cells recorded across sessions were cross-registered using a previously published open-source cross-registration algorithm, CellReg, using the spatial correlations of nearby cells to determine whether highly correlated footprints close in space are likely to be the same cell across sessions.Each offline recording was cross-registered with all the encoding and recall sessions, but not with the other offline sessions because cross-registering between all sessions would lead to too many conflicts and, therefore, to no cells cross-registered across all sessions.Each table represents the output of the cross-registration between one offline sessions and all the encoding and recall sessions. A table maps the global ROI ids (row of the table) to the ROI ids in each of cross-registered session's plane segmentation.
