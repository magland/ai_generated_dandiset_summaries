### Plasma Membrane Conductance Changes in Response to Supraphysiological Hyperpolarization

This study investigated the dynamics of plasma membrane conductance changes in HEK cells subjected to supraphysiological hyperpolarization. The research aimed to visualize and categorize the types of membrane lesions formed during hyperpolarization and elucidate their roles in preventing membrane overcharging. Hyperpolarization to specific voltages induced three distinct types of lesions: diffuse zonal electropermeabilization, focal pores, and high-conductance pores. Notably, adaptive conductance changes were observed, which helped to avert membrane rupture and ensured cellular integrity. This work was supported by NIH grants 1R21EY034258 and 5R21EY034803.

The experimental protocol involved the application of patch clamp techniques, specifically in voltage clamp mode with whole cell configuration. Hyperpolarization pulses were administered in 16 command voltage steps, ranging from -80 mV to -380 mV, with each step lasting 25 ms and applied at 350-ms intervals. Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) imaging was employed to capture cellular responses and structural changes in real-time, at a recording speed of 5.65 ms per frame. The results contribute to the understanding of plasma membrane behavior under extreme conditions, offering insights into mechanisms of cellular protection.
