### Abstract

The experiment aimed to investigate how variability in the timing of electrical brain stimulations influences dopamine release and single-unit activity within the nucleus accumbens. Conducted under anesthesia, stimulation trains were delivered to the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) at 300 ÂµA, and fluctuations in dopamine levels and neuronal responses were monitored using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) and single-unit recordings. This study seeks to provide insights into the neural mechanisms underlying the modulation of dopamine by temporal variations in electrical stimuli, which could have implications for understanding brain stimulation therapies and neurological functions tied to dopamine release.

Data were collected using a range of advanced electrophysiological tools, including FSCV, local field potential (LFP) recordings, and Neuropixels probes. The study was a collaboration between Cowen and Heien Laboratories at the University of Arizona, under the grant 1 R01 NS 123424-01. The experiment also sought to demonstrate the practical application and workflow of the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) format and DANDI for effective data sharing and management.

### Data Available in NWB Files

The NWB files contain multiple datasets and metadata critical for comprehensive analysis:
- **Acquisition TimeSeries**: Includes multiple time series data streams (e.g., FSCV, LFP, and additional series) capturing the real-time signals recorded during stimulation experiments.
- **Devices**: Detailed descriptions of the recording devices used, such as the FSCV probe, LFP probe, and Neuropixels probe.
- **Extracellular Electrophysiology**: Metadata for the extracellular electrodes, including physical properties (e.g., location, impedance) and filtering details.
- **Intervals**: Time intervals for different sleep stages determined by EEG, complete with confidence levels and exact timings.
- **Units**: Information on the single-unit neuronal data, including spike timings, waveform means, and sorting quality of each unit.
