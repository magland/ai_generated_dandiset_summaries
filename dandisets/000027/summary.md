### Abstract

The dataset under DANDI:000027, titled "Test dataset for testing dandi-cli," aims to evaluate the effectiveness and reliability of the DANDI CLI tool for handling Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files. The experiment focuses on the creation and processing of NWB files, ensuring adherence to metadata standards and compatibility across various platforms. Using a Brown rat as the biological model, the study provides foundational data, facilitating further testing and validation of data management workflows within the neuroscience community.

Specifically, the data set is designed for rigorous testing of writing and reading subject information within NWB files. The session description indicates that the file serves as a benchmark for validating metadata completeness and accuracy. The insights from this experiment are expected to guide improvements in the DANDI CLI tool, enhancing its utility for the neuroscience research community by ensuring robust data handling capabilities.

### Available Data

The dataset consists of one NWB file. This NWB file includes:
- **General Information**: Metadata about the NWB file creation date (`2018-04-15T12:00:00-04:00`).
- **Subject Information**: Data specific to the subject used in the test (`TEST_Subject`), identified as a Brown rat.
- **Session Information**: The file documents a session described as a test for writing and reading subject data, with a session start time and timestamps reference time of `1971-01-01T12:00:00+00:00`.
