## Scientific Abstract

This study investigates neural and behavioral responses in Mus musculus (house mouse) utilizing electrophysiological and behavioral approaches. The primary objective of the experiment appears to be to delineate neural activity that correlates with behavioral events and optogenetic stimulation. The subjects were exposed to auditory stimuli of high and low tones, and neural recordings were obtained using Neuropixels probes. Additionally, behavioral tracking was conducted focusing on specific actions such as licks and movements.

Neural activity data was collected using multiple Neuropixels probes (both 1.0 and 2.0 versions) and was complemented by photostimulation to examine the causal effects of neuronal stimulations on behavior. The study carefully documented the timing of various behavioral events such as licking and the phases of the experimental trials (e.g., presample, sample, delay, and go times). The dataset allows for an in-depth analysis of how the brainâ€™s electrophysiology interacts with behavioral outputs and external photostimulation.

## Data Available in NWB Files

The available NWB files contain a comprehensive set of data, including:

- **Behavioral Events**: Timestamps for various event types such as delay start/stop, go start/stop, left and right lick times, photostimulation start/stop times, and different trial phases (e.g., presample, sample, trialend).
- **Behavioral TimeSeries**: Tracking positions for jaw, nose, and tongue.
- **Extracellular Electrophysiology**: Metadata about electrodes, including their locations, impedance, and physical coordinates.
- **Optogenetics**: Information on photostimulation sites and devices used.
- **Trials**: Information about each trial, including auto water delivery, early licks, free water, outcomes, photostim durations/onset/power, start/stop times, task types, and unique trial identifiers.
- **Units**: Data on spike units with attributes such as firing rates, electrode groups, spike times, waveform characteristics, and various metrics related to spike clustering and quality.
