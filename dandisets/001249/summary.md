# Summary

The dataset by Ishii et al. (2023) investigates neuronal activity using the FosTRAP technique in house mice (Mus musculus) to explore the role of cells in the medial preoptic area (MPOA) related to behavioral responses. The experimental setup involves marking and visualizing active neurons in response to specific experimental conditions, which may include behavioral or sensory stimuli. The goal of these studies is to understand activity-dependent gene expression changes in defined neuronal populations and their contribution to complex behaviors, potentially focusing on reproductive or social behaviors given the emphasis on the MPOA.

The dataset spans fourteen individual subjects, with data captured and stored in NWB files conforming to the Neurodata Without Borders standard for better accessibility and reproducibility. The research is centered at the University of Washington, within the Stuber lab, allowing an intricate examination of the neuronal circuits involved through cutting-edge in vivo imaging techniques. By interrogating these circuits, the researchers aim to clarify the underlying neurobiological processes regulated by neurons in the MPOA.

# NWB Files Description

Each NWB file in this dataset contains imaging data acquired to identify TRAPed neurons via the FosTRAP methodology. The `acquisition/TRAP` datasets in the files consist of image series capturing active neuronal populations, while `acquisition/background` datasets provide baseline neuronal activity images for comparative analysis. These data are time-stamped according to the session's initiation and include information about the subjects and experimental context, labeled with relevant identifier and session description, for instance, "Ejaculation_1" and "FosTRAP_MPOA". The files do not include specific descriptions for image series, but hold critical data for analyzing the neuronal activity in response to the experimental conditions assessed during these sessions.
