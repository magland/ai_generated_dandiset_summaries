## Experiment Summary

The dataset "Electrophysiological properties of adult mouse spinal cord neurons - 22Q1_Ephys_DANDI" captures whole-cell patch clamp recordings of specific neuron types in the adult mouse spinal cord. Conducted to investigate the electrophysiological characteristics of neurons that are either input-defined, output-defined, or express specific molecular markers, this research contributes to our understanding of the functional properties of spinal cord neurons. The recordings were meticulously performed using the current clamp technique to understand how these neurons respond to various current injections, providing valuable insights into their biophysical properties.

Internally, the dataset extends across multiple sessions and subjects, as evidenced by the representative NWB files provided. The recordings include responses to long square and short square current clamp stimuli across varying parameters, reflecting typical electrophysiological study designs aimed at understanding how different neuron types react to systematic variations in electrical stimuli. The experimental work was carried out by Bo Peng and Can Tao at Huizhong Tao's lab at the University of Southern California.

## Available Data in NWB Files

The NWB files contain extensive electrophysiological data, including:
- CurrentClampSeries data capturing neuron responses to various current stimuli (e.g., Long_Square_currentClamp_-50 to100_step10pA, short_Square_100pAstepMa1500pA).
- Metadata for each intracellular recording, including information about the intracellular electrode and device used.
- Tables for grouping stimuli and responses associated with specific recording events, as well as references to simultaneous and sequential recordings.
- Experimental details such as session descriptions, timestamps, experimenters, and institutional affiliations.

NWB files consolidate data into a standardized format, enhancing accessibility for analysis and reproducibility. Each file comprises multiple CurrentClampSeries, detailing both the stimuli applied and the neuronâ€™s corresponding electrical response, hosted within a structured schema that facilitates comprehensive data analysis and meta-data inclusion.
