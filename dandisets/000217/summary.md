## Abstract

The dataset titled "Sniff-synchronized, gradient-guided olfactory search by freely moving mice -- Behavioral Dataset" investigates the behavior of mice engaged in olfactory search tasks that are synchronized with their sniffing behavior. The study aims to elucidate the mechanisms by which mice use sniffing to guide their search behavior in environments with odor gradients. By analyzing the movement tracking, sniff recordings, and trial statistics from multiple experimental sessions, the study provides insights into the coupling between sniff patterns and decision-making processes in olfactory-guided tasks.

The experiment involved freely moving mice that were subjected to a series of trials where they had to discern the correct side of an odor concentration gradient and make corresponding choices. Key parameters recorded included the side chosen by the mice (correct or incorrect), the level of odor stimulus presented, and the timing of each trial. The sniffing behavior was also recorded during these trials. This setup allows for a detailed examination of the temporal dynamics between sniffing and olfactory decision-making, contributing to our understanding of sensory processing and behavior coordination in mammals.

## Available Data in the NWB Files

The Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files in this dataset encompass various types of data collected during the experiments. Key contents include:

1. **Subject Information**: Includes identifiers and metadata for each mouse involved in the experiment.
2. **Trial Intervals**: Detailed time interval data for each experimental trial, such as start and stop times, the side of the assay chosen, the correct side of the stimulus, and the concentration level of the odorant presented.
3. **Sniff Signal**: Time-series data capturing the sniffing behavior of the mice during the trials.
4. **Session Information**: Metadata describing each session, including session IDs, start times, and descriptions of the experimental conditions.
