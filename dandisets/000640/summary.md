### Experiment Summary

This study assesses the effects of traumatic brain injury on probabilistic reversal learning in male Long Evans rats, aged 7-12 months. A total of 24 rats were used, with 13 rats receiving a controlled cortical impact to induce traumatic brain injury (TBI) and 11 rats undergoing sham procedures without craniotomy or TBI. One week after injury, all rats were implanted with 32-electrode arrays for recording local field potentials (LFPs) from multiple brain regions. The rats were trained to perform a self-paced probabilistic reversal learning task in a custom-built operant box equipped with noseports, water reward delivery systems, house lights, and auditory tones. The objective was to understand how TBI affects the cognitive processes involved in adapting to changing reward contingencies.

LFP data were recorded simultaneously from various brain regions using a 32-channel RHD headstage connected to an RHD USB interface board (Intan Technologies) and acquired with Open Ephys software at a 1KHz sampling rate with a band-pass filter of 0.3-999Hz. Data integration and synchronization were achieved using Lab-streaming-layer (LSL), allowing physiology data to be time-locked to different phases of the task, including trial onset, response selection, and reward delivery. The study provides valuable insights into the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive flexibility following TBI.
