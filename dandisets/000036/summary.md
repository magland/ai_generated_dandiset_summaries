## Abstract

Understanding the relationship between the coordinated activity of large populations of neurons and perceptual experiences remains a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. This study investigates stimulus-evoked neurophysiological differentiation (ND) in mouse visual cortex, employing two-photon calcium imaging to examine excitatory neuronal populations across different cortical layers (L2/3, L4, and L5) and five distinct visual cortical areas (primary, lateromedial, anterolateral, posteromedial, and anteromedial). The mice were presented with naturalistic and phase-scrambled movie stimuli, allowing for the analysis of how different visual inputs modulate ND. Findings reveal that unscrambled stimuli evoke greater ND than scrambled stimuli, particularly in L2/3 of the anterolateral and anteromedial areas, with modulation by arousal state and locomotion. Interestingly, despite varying levels of ND, decoding performance remained consistently high across visual cortical areas and layers. This suggests that ND could serve as a more nuanced metric for probing the ethological relevance of individual stimuli and their perceptual consequences.

## Data Description

The NWB files contain a wealth of data related to the experiment. Each file includes information on the devices used, particularly the Allen Institute two-photon microscope, and the specifics of the imaging plane. Data captured include the identity of the subject, preprocessed behavioral data, detailed measurements of running velocity, and various stimulus presentations such as conspecifics, crickets, and human montage. Key neuroscience data encompass ROI response series, segmented cells with cell_specimen_ids, and image masks for each ROI provided in a segmentation table. Additional NWB file components are related to different stimuli templates and presentation times across various trials, all under the standard Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) format.
