### Abstract

This study investigates the dynamic responses of neurons in the trigeminal ganglion and lateral hypothalamus to thermal stimuli using advanced 2-photon calcium imaging techniques. Mice were subjected to controlled hot and cold flow stimuli, simulating conditions that could evoke nociceptive or thermoregulatory responses. The primary goal of this research is to elucidate the thermal sensory processing mechanisms within these critical brain regions, which could have wide implications for understanding pain perception and thermoregulation.

Through a detailed analysis of the neuronal responses, this experiment aims to map the functional connectivity and response patterns of neurons under varying thermal conditions. By employing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP, the study provides insights into the activity of glutamatergic neurons within the trigeminal ganglion as they respond to changes in temperature. This research contributes to the broader efforts of decoding sensory inputs and their interpretation within the central nervous system.

### NWB Files Data Description

The NWB files contain raw and processed data from 2-photon calcium imaging sessions. Each file includes the raw acquisition data, captured as photon counts, along with metadata about the imaging plane and optical channels. The dataset also includes processed optical physiology data, such as deconvolved fluorescence signals, background images, and segmentation data that highlights regions of interest (ROIs) identified by suite2p software. Additionally, temperature stimulus time series are documented, providing temporal alignment with the neuronal activity data.
