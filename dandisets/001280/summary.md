## Abstract

The experiment titled "Closed-loop modulation of remote hippocampal representations with neurofeedback" aims to understand the role of hippocampal plasticity in the control and modulation of remote memory traces. Utilizing a cohort of male Long Evans rats, the study deploys closed-loop neurofeedback to manipulate hippocampal representations while recording neural activity from the dorsal hippocampus CA1 region. The primary objective is to elucidate the mechanisms underlying remote memory retrieval and the potential of real-time modulation of specific neural pathways to enhance understanding of memory processing.

This study employs a dual-faceted approach integrating behavioral tasks with advanced electrophysiological techniques. Rats engaged in neurofeedback tasks, with their behavioral performances and corresponding neural activities recorded to examine changes in hippocampal sequences. These insights could contribute to developing therapeutic strategies for memory-related disorders by manipulating memory traces through neurofeedback, offering a promising avenue for cognitive interventions.

## Data Description

The NWB files contained in this dataset comprise a rich variety of data types that capture both behavioral and neural components of the experiment. These include the raw electrical recordings from multiple electrodes targeting the hippocampus, capturing the spontaneous or induced activities of neurons during the tasks. Behavioral data encompasses positional tracking (SpatialSeries) and various event timestamps (BehavioralEvents) such as interactions with task-associated objects. Additionally, concurrent video recordings of the rat's activity throughout the experimental epochs are included. The configuration and metadata related to the experimental setup, including details of devices and probes, are well-documented, ensuring clarity and reproducibility for future analyses.
