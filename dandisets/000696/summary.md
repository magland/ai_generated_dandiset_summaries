## The organization of context versus content coding in the hippocampus and neocortex

High-density silicon probe recordings have been conducted from the primary somatosensory cortex, posterior parietal cortex, and dorsal hippocampus (CA1) in head-fixed mice engaged in a treadmill virtual reality task with varying tactile cues. The aim is to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying context versus content coding in these brain regions. The mice are exposed to different tactile cues while running in a controlled virtual reality environment, allowing for precise manipulation and measurement of neural activity. The study hypothesizes distinct coding strategies for context and content within the hippocampus and neocortex.

Through this setup, the research seeks to disentangle how the hippocampus and neocortex process contextual versus content-specific information. By employing a high-density multi-electrode array, the study collects detailed electrophysiological data, providing insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of neural encoding. These findings could significantly advance our understanding of neural circuitry involved in sensory processing, memory, and behavioral context interpretation.

## Available Data in the NWB Files

The NWB files include extensive electrophysiological data acquired from various brain regions of the mice. Specifically, each NWB file contains voltage data recorded from the amplifiers of an Intan Technologies chip, alongside auxiliary, analog, and digital input data. Metadata about the electrodes, including their impedance, phase, and spatial coordinates, are also provided. Each file documents the configuration and specifications of the recording devices used, such as the 512-channel or 1024-channel RHD2000 Recording Controller by Intan Technologies.

The datasets also include details on the electrode groups, their respective channels, and filtering parameters used during data acquisition. Furthermore, the files catalog the session-specific information, including session start time, session descriptions focusing on cue swaps across VR contexts, and timestamps. Collectively, these datasets furnish a comprehensive repository for analyzing the electrophysiological responses under varied tactile stimulation in a controlled experimental setup.
