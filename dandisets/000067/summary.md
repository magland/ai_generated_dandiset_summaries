### Scientific Abstract

Short-term plasticity is hypothesized to be pivotal in cortical computation, but empirical data on its role during behavior is limited. This study investigates short-term plasticity signatures in the medial prefrontal cortex of rats engaged in a working memory task. The research focuses on the fine-timescale spiking relationships in a simultaneously recorded population of pyramidal cells and interneurons. Through the experiment, dynamically and predictably modulated putative monosynaptic interactions were observed across various task aspects, reflecting short-term plasticity beyond the neurons' co-varying firing rates. Sequentially organized and transiently active neurons effectively differentiated between different maze trajectories at broader timescales. Evidence for both firing pattern–dependent facilitation and depression, as well as a supralinear effect of presynaptic coincidence on postsynaptic target firing, was found.

The experiment demonstrates how fine-timescale neural dynamics are influenced by short-term plasticity mechanisms during a working memory task. The findings highlight the complex interplay of neuronal interactions and suggest potential mechanisms underpinning observed plasticity effects. This study broadens our understanding of how short-term plasticity may contribute to behavioral tasks, offering insights into cortical computation processes.

### Data Description in NWB Files

The available data in the NWB files include detailed electrophysiological recordings and metadata. Specific datasets encompass:

- **Electrical data:** Raw acquisition traces and local field potential (LFP) signals from the implanted silicon probes in the rats' prefrontal cortex.
- **Electrode metadata:** Information about the electrodes, including the positioning, impedance, and filtering description.
- **Behavioral data:** Processed behavioral data such as experimental trials, linearized positions, and subject movement coordinates through the maze (both raw and spatially linearized form).
- **Spike times:** Detailed unit spike time data including spike times for each unit and associated indices.
- **Additional metadata:** Session details, dates, experimenter names, subject identifiers, and experimental conditions.
