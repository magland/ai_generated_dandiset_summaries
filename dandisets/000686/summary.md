## Abstract

This study explores the feasibility of remote cell targeting via electroporation using sequences of unipolar nanosecond electric pulses (nsEP). By incorporating rotational sequences of these pulses, the efficiency of electroporation was further enhanced. Electroporation efficacy was assessed through the uptake of a cell-impermeable dye, YoPro-1, providing both visual and quantitative measures of cell membrane permeabilization. The research was partially supported by the National Eye Institute under grant R21EY034258.

The experiments were conducted using a quadrupole array of blunt, hollow, stainless-steel needle electrodes, delivering packets of 15 pulses, each 600 nanoseconds long. The initial pulse sequence began with a 6.4 kV pulse delivered by a designated electrode, followed by pairs of pulses applied diagonally across the array with 12.5% reduced amplitude for each subsequent pair. This sequence was repeated sequentially for the remaining electrodes over multiple cycles at a frequency of 1 Hz. The outcomes suggest that the methodology enables precise and efficient electroporation, demonstrating potential for applications in cellular and biomedical research.
