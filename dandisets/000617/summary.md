### Allen Institute Openscope - Sequence Learning Project

The Allen Institute Openscope Sequence Learning Project aims to explore predictive coding mechanisms within the neocortex by utilizing a sequence learning paradigm in mice. The experiment investigates how head-fixed mice process sequences of visual stimuli, consisting of natural movie clips, to uncover alterations in neural responses due to sequence learning. Over the progression of several days, mice are exposed to a series of movie clips presented both randomly and in structured temporal order to assess the neocortex's ability to form predictions about forthcoming stimuli. This research endeavors to provide empirical evidence for the theoretical concept of hierarchical predictive coding in multiple cortical areas, addressing a gap in experimental validation of this canonical computation hypothesis.

Utilizing advanced 2-photon microscopy, the study captures neural activity across multiple cortical layers and regions in the excitatory neurons of Cux2-CreERTS2:Camk2a-tTa; Ai93(TITL-GCaMP6f) mice. Precise recordings from areas including V1 (VISp), LM (VISl), AM (VISam), and PM (VISpm) enable comprehensive analysis of the visual processing and learning dynamics in response to the structured and random visual stimuli presentations. The dataset generated through this project promises novel insights into the nature of predictive neural computations and their role in adaptive behavior and sensory-motor integration.

### Data Available in NWB Files

The NWB files encompass a detailed record of the experimental sessions including times and details of stimulus presentations, captured neural responses, and processed imaging data. Specifically, they contain time interval data for the presentation of gray screens and movie clips (A, B, C), along with respective stimulus attributes such as contrast, size, and orientation. The TwoPhotonSeries data includes motion-corrected imaging signals, and the corresponding processing modules provide corrected fluorescence, event detection, and image segmentation outputs, with segmentations detailed in the PlaneSegmentation table. Additionally, running wheel data, calcium imaging data processed into âˆ†F/F traces, and metadata related to the experimental setup are meticulously documented.
