### Abstract

The study investigates the swimming behavior of zebrafish (_Danio rerio_) in a thermally uniform environment maintained at a constant temperature of 16Â°C. The experiment aimed to explore the cold avoidance behavior of zebrafish by observing their movement patterns in a controlled setting. Conducted at THE Ohio State University, the research utilized a Gradient Behavior Chamber to maintain environmental conditions and to monitor the fish's positional data over time. This setup allowed researchers to assess whether zebrafish exhibit a preference or aversion to constant low temperatures, providing insights into their thermoregulatory behaviors.

The experimental design involved tracking the movements of 15 individual fish over a 30-minute period within a chamber of set dimensions, specifically monitoring their spatial positioning and orientation at a high resolution of 7 pixels/mm. The study used advanced behavioral and analytical techniques to process the movement data, capturing detailed information on both compass direction and positional data for fish within distinct lanes of the chamber. Through comprehensive data collection, the study aimed to deepen the understanding of zebrafish responses to cold environments, contributing valuable information to the broader field of behavioral neuroscience.

### NWB File Data Description

The Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files contain comprehensive data on the spatial and behavioral parameters of zebrafish in the experimental conditions. Within these files, data have been processed to include positional coordinates (in mm) and absolute heading directions (in radians) of the fish. Behavioral data are captured as part of a `ProcessingModule`, distinguishing movements in both left and right lanes of the gradient chamber. For each lane, separate `SpatialSeries` datasets provide fine-grained temporal data on heading and position. They also include `BehavioralTimeSeries` data capturing the temperature at the fish's position, ensuring that the environmental conditions at the time of observation are meticulously recorded.
