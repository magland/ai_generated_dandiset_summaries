### Experiment Summary
This study investigates the effects of electrical stimulation on neural ensemble activity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of anesthetized rats. Employing acute random and fixed burst stimulation paradigms, the primary objective is to understand how these different modes of stimulation impact neural patterns. Neuropixels probes were utilized to record from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the medial forebrain bundle (MFB), areas known to be involved in reward processing and decision making. The experiment was conducted by researchers from the Cowen and Heien labs at the University of Arizona and was supported by the BRAIN Initiative under award number NS123424-01.

The use of high-density Neuropixels probes facilitates the recording of electrical activity with high temporal and spatial resolution, allowing for accurate spike sorting and analysis of neural firing patterns. Understanding the neural mechanisms of electrical stimulation could shed light on potential therapeutic approaches for neuropsychiatric disorders.

### Available Data in NWB Files
The dataset includes 12 Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files, representing data from 12 subjects (Rattus norvegicus - Norway rat). Each file contains data from a single experimental session with the identifier "Rat406_PFC." The data files hold detailed metadata including the file creation date, experimenter names (Joe L. Schmoe and Jane B. Schmoe), institution, labs involved, and session description. Primary data includes spike times indexed by unit IDs, recorded with specific timestamps referenced to the given session start time. The primary data consists of spike times and indexed spike times from the recorded units. The total dataset size is approximately 19.5 MB.
