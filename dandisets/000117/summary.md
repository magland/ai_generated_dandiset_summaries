### Experiment Summary

This dataset comprises patch-clamp recordings from spinal cord neurons, conducted at Dr. Huizhong Tao's lab at the University of Southern California (USC). These recordings, performed by Can Tao and Bo Peng, investigate the electrophysiological properties of these neurons using both current-clamp and voltage-clamp techniques. The recordings potentially aim to characterize the neuronal responses to a variety of electrical stimuli, providing insight into their biophysical properties and synaptic behaviors.

The dataset is structured to include data from 197 subjects, resulting in 58 NWB files. The experiments recorded multiple types of stimulus-response protocols, encompassing repetitive current clamp, long square current clamp, ramp protocols, and more sophisticated short square stimuli. These varied stimuli are likely used to probe different aspects of neuronal functionality, such as action potential generation, synaptic integration, and intrinsic electrophysiological characteristics.

### Data Description

The available NWB files capture several key data types:
1. **Type 1**: These files include "IZeroClampSeries" acquisitions with multiple cycles using the "Current Clamp 1" protocol, profiling membrane potential and current measurements.
2. **Type 2**: Files in this category depict "CurrentClampSeries" acquisitions with detailed long square current clamp stimuli, offering extensive membrane potential and current measurements at different steps.
3. **Type 3**: This set includes recordings from the "Ramp_250pA" protocol, delivering membrane potential and current data.
4. **Type 4**: Data from the "short_Square_100pAstepMa1500pA" protocol, capturing responses to short square wave stimuli and their respective membrane potential and current.
5. **Type 5**: These files involve another variant of the long square current clamp protocol, documented with multiple cycles capturing neuronal responses to varied step stimuli.

All files feature detailed metadata including electrode details, device specifications, and experiment protocols, supporting comprehensive analysis and reproducibility.
