# NG-CANCAN Remote Targeting Electroporation: Impact of Burst Number Variation on Permeabilization Distribution in Confluent Cell Monolayers

This study investigates the optimization of the NG-CANCAN protocol, specifically focusing on the impact of varying burst numbers on the distribution of permeabilization in confluent cell monolayers. Experiments were carried out using a four-electrode array with a 10.0 mm inter-electrode distance. The protocol involved the delivery of canceling pulses designed to minimize cell damage near the electrodes, while effectively targeting cells in the center of the electrode array. Each single pulse within the protocol had a duration of 600 ns, organized into nine packets of pulses delivered at a frequency of 0.2 MHz which was repeated up to six times at a frequency of 1 Hz. The researchers used Hoechst staining to assess cell monolayer integrity and YoPro-1 to evaluate membrane permeability, thereby providing insight into the effectiveness and safety of the NG-CANCAN protocol.

The Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files provide a comprehensive dataset from this electromagnetically driven biological experiment. The NWB files contain both pre- and post-exposure imaging sessions that highlight cell responses to the NG-CANCAN protocol. Fluorescent channels capture Hoechst and YP staining, visualizing nuclear integrity and membrane permeability respectively. The imaging data collected allow for a semi-quantitative analysis of permeabilization across different experimental conditions. Specifically, data were generated under protocols that varied the number of pulse cycles repeated and the amplitude of subsequent pulses following the initial pulse from a given electrode. With detailed annotations and structured data on experimental setups, imaging parameters, and results, these files are an invaluable resource for understanding the controlled electroporation process and permeabilization outcomes.
