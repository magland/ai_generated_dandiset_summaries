## Abstract

This study investigates the navigational behavior of larval zebrafish within a specially crafted virtual thermal environment termed the 'thermal plaid.' Utilizing an advanced infrared laser stimulus in a thermally controlled chamber, zebrafish were subjected to steep thermal gradients designed to assess their locomotor responses and thermoregulatory behaviors in virtual environments. The primary aim is to elucidate how zebrafish integrate thermal cues into their navigational decision-making processes, contributing to broader insights into thermosensory function and related neural circuits. This research is critical for understanding the fundamental principles of sensory integration and navigational strategies in zebrafish, which serve as a model organism for neurological studies.

The experiment, funded by the National Institutes of Health, involved a cohort of 104 zebrafish, with precise tracking and recording of behavioral patterns over specified time phases. Fish were habituated and then exposed to variable thermal conditions modeled by differential laser settings to simulate distinct thermal patterns. This precise modulation of environmental temperature aims to mimic naturalistic thermal structures, allowing an unprecedented analysis of zebrafish behavior under controlled conditions.

## NWB File Data Description

The dataset comprises 52 NWB files, each encompassing detailed experimental data regarding behavioral responses and environmental conditions. Key data entries include acquisition images portraying the chamber setup, positional tracking of subjects within the environment, and metrics such as cumulative tail angle and fish heading. Data acquisition was performed at a frame rate of 250 Hz with a resolution of 8 pixels per mm, capturing nuanced movements and alignment of zebrafish in response to the simulated thermal stimuli. Additional recorded data spans various experimental phasesâ€”habituation, gradient exposure, and plaid interaction, providing a comprehensive temporal profile of zebrafish behavior. The stimulus conditions are documented with parameters such as infrared laser power at specific points in the setup.
