## Abstract

The EEG Anesthesia Dataset explores the neurophysiological signatures associated with the induction and emergence from propofol anesthesia. Conducted on ten healthy volunteers aged 18â€“36 and approved by the MGH Human Research Committee, the study utilized a computer-controlled infusion system based on the Schnider pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model to administer propofol. During the experiment, the subjects engaged in a yes-no behavioral task to identify the junctures of loss and recovery of consciousness, whilst 64-channel EEG recordings were obtained. The experimental protocol encompassed a baseline EEG recording, followed by incremental and then decremental propofol administrations. Each concentration phase lasted approximately 14 minutes, with behavioral assessments employed to document consciousness transitions. The study contributes valuable insights into the EEG correlates of anesthesia, focusing on critical consciousness thresholds.

The study's meticulous design included phases for both increasing and decreasing concentrations of propofol, effectively bracketing the transition point for loss of consciousness. This was followed by a 20-minute post-infusion baseline period, during which both EEG and behavioral data were collected. Participants remained with their eyes closed throughout the procedure to minimize artifacts, ensuring the integrity of the EEG data. The findings from this dataset provide a comprehensive understanding of the neural activity associated with anesthetic-induced alterations of consciousness.

## Available Data in NWB Files

The NWB file in this dataset contains comprehensive data on EEG recordings and associated metadata from the experiment sessions. Specifically, the file includes a TimeSeries object within the acquisition group that holds the EEG recordings, although it lacks a detailed description. Additional metadata, such as the experimenter information and subject details are included in the file, alongside the session description and start time. The EEG data are available in the standardized Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) format, ensuring compatibility for further analysis by researchers.
