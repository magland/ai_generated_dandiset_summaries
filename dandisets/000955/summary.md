### Abstract

This study aims to investigate the neuronal responses in rats to both optogenetic stimulation and transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) stimulation within the somatosensory cortex. Male Wistar rats, genetically modified to express CaMKII, were injected with AAV virus to enable optogenetic tagging for the differentiation between excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons. The experiment alternates between optogenetic and tFUS stimulations to assess neuronal subtype and response characteristics under various pulse repetition frequencies (PRFs) and pulse durations. Electrophysiological recordings were obtained through 32-channel NeuroNexus electrodes surgically implanted into the rat brains, with ultrasound stimulation delivered every 2.5 seconds with a 10% jitter across 500 trials.

The objective was to explore how different PRFs (ranging from 30 Hz to 4500 Hz) and pulse durations (spanning from 4 to 400 microseconds) affect neuronal activity, with optogenetic stimulation parameters set at 120A for 10ms. This dataset provides critical insights into the interplay between optogenetic and ultrasound stimulations on neuronal subtypes in the primary somatosensory cortex, potentially facilitating advancements in neural modulation therapies.

### Data Description

The dataset consists of 11 Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files, each capturing vital electrophysiological data from the experiment. For each file, data includes detailed spike timings, recorded with 32-channel NeuroNexus electrodes. Key information stored in these files encompasses trial onset and offset times, PRF and pulse duration specifics, and detailed electrode attributes such as location and impedance. Time-series data are provided for each trial, documenting both ultrasound and optogenetic stimulation events. The specific NWB datasets also include electrode group descriptions, units table detailing spike sorting results, and session metadata including unique identifiers, session descriptions, and time stamps.
