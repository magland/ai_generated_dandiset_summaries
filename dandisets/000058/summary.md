## MITU01 Dataset: Structural and Parameter Mapping at 7T MRI

In this study, 7T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was utilized to obtain high-resolution structural images alongside B0 and B1+ code-corrected parameter maps. The primary aim of the experiment is likely to explore intricate details of brain anatomy that can be captured at ultra-high field strength, and to enhance the accuracy of the acquired images using parameter correction techniques. The use of 7T MRI allows for superior resolution, which is essential for detailed morphological studies and could also aid in better parameter estimation for correcting artifacts caused by magnetic field inhomogeneities (B0) and radiofrequency field inhomogeneities (B1+).

The dataset consists of a substantial volume of MR structural images and related parameter maps from an ultra-high field 7T MRI machine. This high field strength offers increased sensitivity and specificity, which is critical for advanced neuroimaging research. The corrections applied to B0 and B1+ maps aim to mitigate distortions and signal loss, leading to more accurate representation of the brain structure. Such data is invaluable for both clinical and research settings, where precise brain imaging is necessary for diagnosis, treatment planning, and understanding neuroanatomical variations.

### Data Available in NWB Files

Although the metadata summary indicates that there are no NWB files included in this particular Dandiset, the provided details suggest that if present, the NWB files would house time-series data, imaging data, and associated metadata. Given the emphasis on MR structural images and parameter maps, the NWB files would typically include high-resolution volumetric data, corrected B0 and B1+ parameter maps, and possibly other supporting data such as subject information and session details.
