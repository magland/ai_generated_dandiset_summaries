# Abstract

The study investigated the impact of anesthesia and surgery on hippocampal neural dynamics in aged mice, emphasizing postoperative delirium-like (POD-like) behaviors. Utilizing a model for POD in older mice, the research explored the influence of anesthesia/surgery on electrophysiological signals through in vivo calcium imaging. Furthermore, the intervention also analyzed the effects of indole 3-propionic acid (IPA) on POD-like behavior and neural activity, marking a significant advance in understanding postoperative complications in an aging population. Employing both electrophysiological approaches and calcium imaging, the study aimed to unravel the complexities of neural circuit disruptions linked to POD.

The investigation involved rigorous electrophysiological assessments to trace the neural activity changes resulting from surgical procedures. By deploying multi-electrode extracellular electrophysiology recording techniques, researchers ensured a meticulous evaluation of electrical signal alterations across different brain regions of aged mice. Moreover, through treatment with IPA, the study critically evaluated the potential mitigating effects of this compound on POD-like symptoms and neural dynamics, providing insights that could guide future therapeutic strategies.

# NWB Files Description

The NWB files capture detailed electrophysiological data from mice undergoing surgical procedures. Each file documents acquisition traces for the ElectricalSeries, complete with metadata about extracellular electrodes. Dynamics across 384 electrodes are recorded, highlighting information such as channel references, group affiliations, and sampling data. These files are crafted to provide comprehensive metadata about the experimental setup and subjects, including identifiers and extra-cellular electrophysiology details. The recordings are pivotal in analyzing the neural circuit alterations involved in postoperative delirium-like behavior.
