## Scientific Abstract

Investigators in the Frank laboratory at UCSF recorded neural activity from four brain regions—hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), nucleus accumbens (NAc), and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)—using 64-channel polymer probes. The purpose of the study was likely to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying memory processing, particularly in a three-choice memory task. The recordings were conducted on an animal at rest in a controlled environment, where the subject was placed in a box during the experimental session.

These regions were selected due to their known involvement in memory and decision-making processes. By employing high-density polymer probes, the researchers aimed to capture detailed extracellular voltage recordings, which are crucial for understanding the communication between these regions during rest and task performance. Additionally, the use of multiple brain regions allows for a comprehensive analysis of synchronous activity and functional connectivity.

## Data Description

The NWB files contain extensive data, including the primary extracellular voltage recordings across 64 channels. The dataset also includes metadata about the electrodes, such as their location, impedance, and group affiliations. Specific details on the experimental setup, including information about devices like various probes and the camera used, are provided. Behavioral events and timestamps are captured in the `processing` group, which includes data on positions, video recordings of the animal during epochs, and event markers. The recordings cover multiple electrodes arranged in different shanks of the probes, enhancing the spatial resolution of the recorded data.
