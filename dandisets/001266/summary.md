### Abstract

This study investigates the mechanisms by which dendritic excitations influence spike propagation in neuronal networks, particularly focusing on how they act as a spike-rate accelerometer. Using dendritic voltage imaging in mouse hippocampal brain slices, the research employs Optopatch-V technology to simultaneously monitor and manipulate neuronal activity. The expression of LR-Voltron2-p2a-LR-CheRiff-eYFP was achieved via in utero electroporation, and the voltage indicator was subsequently loaded with the JFx608 HTL dye. Through a series of controlled optogenetic stimulations conducted on a custom one-photon microscope, the study aims to uncover how specific patterns of dendritic activity contribute to the modulation of back-propagation, thereby refining our understanding of synaptic integration and plasticity.

The experiments are characterized by various experimental setups, notably including SNAPT, patch clamp techniques, and investigations into period doubling and plateau potentials. The data generated provide a comprehensive view of dendritic function at the cellular level, potentially elucidating the roles of specific ion channels and synaptic inputs. This work advances the understanding of neuronal signal processing and could have implications for developing novel neurotechnological applications.

### Available Data in NWB Files

The dataset comprises 83 NWB files, each capturing different experimental conditions and parameters. In type 1 files, data include image series from camera 1, device information, and time series data from acquisition channels focused on voltage modulation. Type 2 files expand on this with additional channels capturing primary and secondary output signals related to patch clamp experiments. Type 3 files present similar data collection structures but associated with period doubling phenomena. Type 4 files include acquisition channels for distal stimulation experiments, while the sole type 5 file is focused on eYFP calibration data. Each file captures timestamps, identifiers, session descriptions, and institutional affiliations, providing a robust framework for data analysis.
