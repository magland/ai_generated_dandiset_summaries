## Experiment Summary

The experiment aimed to understand the spatial and temporal propagation of spiking activity in response to electrical stimulation in the visual cortex. The electrical stimuli, consisting of single pulses with varying amplitude and polarity, were delivered near the middle layers of the primary visual cortex. The experiment utilized three simultaneous Neuropixels 1.0 electrodes, placed roughly orthogonally around the stimulation site. The electrodes covered a region of at least one millimeter in all directions around the stimulation point, capturing data across cortical area boundaries and nearby deeper brain structures such as the hippocampus.

The intent of the study was to provide a detailed, three-dimensional measurement of electrical activity around a localized point of stimulation. By varying the amplitude and polarity of the stimuli and capturing the precise spatiotemporal pattern of neuronal responses, the research could elucidate the mechanisms of signal propagation in the neocortex. The results could have significant implications for understanding neural communication and information processing in the brain, particularly in the context of electrically stimulated neural circuits.
