## Abstract

The study investigates the phenomenon of broken time reversal symmetry in motion detection within the visual systems of the fruit fly Drosophila. Classical models posit that reversing a sequence of visual stimuli should produce an inversion in perceived motion. Here, it is demonstrated that this is not the case in biological systems. A set of unique visual stimuli were formulated to explore the impact of stimulus symmetry on time reversal symmetry breaking in the optomotor responses of Drosophila. The findings reveal that various embodiments of these stimuli can lead to disrupted symmetry in the flies' behavioral responses.

Further analysis involved training neural network models to predict scene velocities using both natural and artificial contrast distributions. The models, trained on time-reversal symmetric naturalistic data, exhibited time reversal symmetry-breaking properties. It was shown that contrast asymmetry in training data can induce these effects even when the training inputs are symmetric. Additionally, shallower neural networks displayed stronger symmetry breaking compared to deeper architectures, suggesting a correlation between model flexibility and symmetry breaking. The results provide new insights into how biological systems process motion and highlight the influence of constrained optimization within natural environments.

## Data Description

The NWB files available for this Dandiset contain extensive data on the optomotor turning behavior of Drosophila melanogaster in response to various visual stimuli. Each file includes time series data capturing the flies' movements on an air-supported ball. Metadata detailing the experimental conditions, such as session start times, subject identifiers, and the specific visual stimuli used, are also included. The experiments and data collection were conducted at Yale University's Clark Lab under the supervision of Nathan Wu.
