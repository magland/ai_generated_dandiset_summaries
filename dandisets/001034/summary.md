## Experiment Summary

The experimental series aimed to characterize the triggering of action potentials (APs) in neurons using sine waves and modulated sine waves at varying frequencies. Conducted on E18 Sprague Dawley rat hippocampal neurons, the experiments employed the voltage-sensitive dye FluoVolt as an AP reporter to optically record transmembrane potential changes. The primary objective was to understand how neurons respond to electrical stimulation at various frequencies, potentially providing insights into the mechanisms underlying neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission.

Data acquisition involved time-lapse fluorescence imaging using an IX71 microscope with a PlanApo N 60x, 1.42 NA objective and an iXon Ultra 897 back-illuminated CCD camera. Electrical stimulation was applied using a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator, with exposures synchronized to image acquisition via a TTL pulse protocol. The experimental setup included precise positioning of tungsten electrodes and simulation-based determination of the electric field applied. Recordings consisted of high-frame-rate image stacks, providing detailed optical data on neuron activity over short time spans.

## Available Data in NWB Files

The Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files in this Dandiset primarily contain time-lapse image series acquired through fluorescence microscopy. The data detail the optical responses of hippocampal neurons loaded with the voltage-sensitive dye FluoVolt under varied sine wave stimulations. Each file includes metadata on experimental conditions such as session description, stimulus parameters, and acquisition details. Specific data points encompass the frame-by-frame fluorescence intensity changes corresponding to neuronal APs triggered by electromagnetic stimuli of different frequencies and amplitudes. Additional metadata includes details about the experimental setup, imaging equipment, and exposure synchronization protocols.
