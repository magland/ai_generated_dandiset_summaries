## Abstract

Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) form a crucial part of the neural basis for spatial navigation by providing an environment-independent spatial coordinate system. This study aimed to elucidate the integration of spatial information such as location, direction, and velocity within the grid-cell network. Electrophysiological recordings were obtained from various principal cell layers in the MEC of rats exploring two-dimensional arenas. While layer II predominantly housed grid cells, deeper layers exhibited co-localization of grid cells with head-direction cells and conjunctive grid x head-direction cells. All recorded cell types were found to be modulated by the running speed of the rats, suggesting a complex interplay of positional, directional, and translational information in the MEC that may support self-motion-based navigation.

## Data Description

The available data in the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files comprises extensive recordings and observations from the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) of rats. The dataset includes spike times for recorded grid cells, with behavioral data capturing the rats' position via tracking LEDs. Available datasets feature electrophysiological data (amplified EEG signals, lowpass-filtered, and stored), include detailed metadata on electrodes and devices used, and processed data for both behavior and electrical series. Specific measured variables include ElectricalSeries, Position, Units, ElectrodeGroup, ProcessingModule, and LFP. Sessions document spike and position times and provide positions for two LEDs to calculate head direction.
