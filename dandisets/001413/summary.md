## Abstract

This dataset comprises calcium imaging data from the supplementary motor area (SMA) and primary motor cortex (M1) of macaque monkeys engaged in arm-reaching tasks. Using this translational approach, the experiment aims to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying motor planning and execution in primates. By capturing real-time neural activity via calcium imaging, researchers can discern how specific neuronal circuits contribute to the complex movements necessary for goal-directed arm reaching, potentially drawing parallels to motor control in humans.

The collection of data focuses on employing a miniscope (NVista3) to measure calcium activity as an indirect marker of neural firing, highlighting the role of these brain regions in motor coordination. This experimental setup facilitates the observation of neuronal population dynamics with high spatial and temporal resolution. Through detailed analysis of individual and collective neuron responses, the study seeks to advance our understanding of motor control processes, augmenting the potential for developing neuroprosthetic devices that bridge damaged motor pathways.

## NWB File Data Description

The NWB file contains extensive data from the experiment including miniscope imaging acquisition data, segmented imaging planes, and processed optical physiology data. The imaging data was captured using a NVista3 device with detailed fluorescence data associated with specific regions of interest (ROIs). Image segmentation reveals the spatial footprints of individual cells, providing insight into neuronal dynamics. The dataset includes processed data which represent the amplitude of neural events and fluorescence ROI response series, facilitating further computational analysis of neural activity during motor tasks.
