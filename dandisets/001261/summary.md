## Abstract

The amygdala-basal forebrain neural circuitry is critical in regulating emotional and cognitive functions, with projections from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) and substantia innominata (SI) representing a significant pathway influencing cortical activity. This study examines the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of BLA-projecting cholinergic neurons within the NBM/SI across two species: the house mouse (*Mus musculus*) and the rhesus monkey (*Macaca mulatta*). Using slice preparations and intracellular recordings, we employ current clamp techniques to analyze the response characteristics of these neurons to injected current stimuli. This comparative investigation aims to enhance our understanding of the preservation and variation in cholinergic systems across species and their role in modulating cortical dynamics.

The data set under review comprises 46 Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files, detailing electrophysiological experiments conducted on 38 individual subjects. Intracellular recordings were obtained, and systematic current steps were applied to assess neuron excitability and responsiveness to subthreshold and suprathreshold inputs. The experimental design and data collection follow a structured protocol to ensure consistency and reliability, utilizing custom MATLAB analysis tools. These findings contribute to a deeper comprehension of the functional and morphological characteristics of key neural circuits involved in cognitive and emotional regulation.

## Data Description

The NWB files in Dandiset 001261 document detailed intracellular current clamp recordings from BLA-projecting NBM/SI neurons. Each file contains comprehensive data capturing neuron responses to a series of injected current steps ranging from -60 to 200 pA. The dataset includes data acquired from both mouse and macaque specimens, offering cross-species analysis potential. Acquisitions are well-documented with metadata entries specifying electrode configurations, the digitization hardware used, and timestamps for each session. Neural responses under controlled holding potentials around -65 mV are available, consisting of multiple stimulus-response pairs for robust analysis. Data were processed and quality-checked using customized software pipelines in MATLAB, annotated in the metadata of each NWB file. Overall, the data provided offer a rich resource for the exploration of cholinergic neuronal dynamics within the BLA-NBM/SI projection system.
