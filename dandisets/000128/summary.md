## MC_Maze: Macaque Primary Motor and Dorsal Premotor Cortex Spiking Activity During Delayed Reaching

### Abstract

This dataset presents neural and behavioral data collected from a Rhesus monkey engaged in a delayed reaching task with obstructing barriers forming various maze configurations. The primary objective was to examine the spiking activity in the primary motor cortex (M1) and dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) during complex motor planning and execution. Recordings were made using 96-electrode Utah arrays implanted in M1 and PMd, capturing detailed neural responses during both straightforward and curved reaching movements. The behavioral component of the experiment recorded the monkey's hand position, eye position, and cursor position, with hand velocity computed offline. This dataset is part of the Neural Latents Benchmark project aimed at developing and evaluating models for interpreting neural data.

### Data Description

The dataset consists of two Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files, each containing comprehensive neural and behavioral data. Both NWB files include a detailed map of extracellular ephys electrodes, positional recordings, and spiking unit data. Specific datasets within these files provide information on the electrode properties, trial intervals, spike times, and behavioral metrics such as hand and eye positions. Data from one NWB file focus more on detailed segment recording of trials used for model evaluation, while the other provides full session data suitable for training models. These files also contain metadata about the recording devices, brain region locations, and the configuration of maze tasks.
