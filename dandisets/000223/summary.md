### Inferring Monosynaptic Connections from Paired Spine Calcium Imaging and Large-Scale Recording of Extracellular Spiking

This experiment investigates the monosynaptic connections in cortical embryonic cell cultures derived from Rattus norvegicus (Norway rat). The primary methodology combines high-density microelectrode array (HD-MEA) recordings with super-resolution calcium imaging of dendritic spines. The objective is to infer functional connectivity by correlating extracellular spiking activity with calcium transients observed in dendritic spines. This approach allows for the fine-scale mapping of synaptic activity and connectivity at the single-spine level, providing insights into the microscale organization of neuronal networks.

The dataset contains integrated datasets of both raw and processed data. The HD-MEA records the extracellular electrical signals from a large population of neurons simultaneously, capturing spiking activity. Concurrently, the two-photon calcium imaging records fluorescence signals at the dendritic spines, representing synaptic activity. The datasets include raw electrical recordings, spike-sorted units, imaging series, segmented regions of interest (ROIs), and other metadata detailing the spatial and temporal parameters of the recordings.

### Available Data in NWB Files

The NWB files from this dataset contain detailed acquired and processed data for both electrophysiological and optical measurements. The raw extracellular recordings include the spike times and spike-sorted units. Additionally, calcium imaging data includes fluorescence signals tied to ROIs at the dendritic spines and adjacent dendritic shafts. The files also contain significant metadata about the recording devices, such as details of the Mea1k HD-MEA and two-photon microscopy setups used. The processed data includes measures such as plane segmentation and ROI centroid locations, with accompanying segmentation acceptance and rejection metrics.
