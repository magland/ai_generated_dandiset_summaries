## Abstract

The primary aim of this study was to investigate the swimming behavior of zebrafish (*Danio rerio*) in a controlled thermal environment maintained at a constant temperature of 34Â°C. The experiment was conducted under constant light conditions to eliminate light-driven variabilities in behavior. These conditions were designed to understand how zebrafish regulate their movement in a uniformly heated environment, which could provide insights into locomotor responses and thermal preference mechanisms in aquatic species. This research was sponsored by the National Institutes of Health under award number 5 R01 NS 123887-03.

The experiment utilized a behavioral approach in a Gradient Behavior Chamber, focusing on the spatial and directional movements of zebrafish, recorded with a high frame rate of 100 Hz. Each fish's movement was tracked across designated lanes within the chamber, and data were collected on their positional coordinates, heading direction, and the temperature at those positions. The entire observational session spanned 30 minutes, beginning at 12:02 PM and ending at 12:32:50 PM on July 5, 2023. The study was orchestrated by Kaarthik Balakrishnan at The Ohio State University, with care taken to ensure a comprehensive behavioral analysis through sophisticated monitoring and data collection techniques.

## Available Data

The NWB files from Dandiset 000706 encompass a range of datasets capturing essential behavioral metrics under the experimental setup. Each NWB file documents the behavior of individual zebrafish within the gradient chamber, specifically focusing on two lanes: left and right. Key data include the fish heading, expressed as absolute compass direction, and their chamber position tracked in millimeter-based spatial coordinates. Moreover, the data captures temperature metrics at specific fish positions across the swimming lanes, providing insights into real-time hot avoidance behavior. Additionally, metadata relevant to the raw experimental setup and environmental parameters, such as front and back temperatures of the chamber, are recorded in `ScratchData` datasets. Across 16 files, each subject's behavior was systematically analyzed using behavioral and analytical techniques.
