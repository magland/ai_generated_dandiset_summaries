## Abstract

This study investigates the behavior of Danio rerio, commonly known as zebrafish, under constant cold temperature conditions in a controlled environment. The experiment primarily aims to observe the fish's swimming behavior at a steady 18°C, which is crucial for understanding the species' response to low-temperature environments. Conducted at THE Ohio State University, the experiment uses a Gradient Behavior Chamber to standardize the temperature across trials, ensuring that the conditions remain constant. The fish, at five days post-fertilization (dpf), are expected to exhibit distinct patterns of movement that can provide insights into their thermal preference and avoidance behavior at the given temperature.

The experiment involves monitoring the directional headings and positions of zebrafish within a chamber that replicates a homogeneous cold environment. The data collected include comprehensive spatial tracking and temperature readings at the fish's position over a 30-minute session. The results are geared towards contributing to a deeper understanding of cold-induced behavior in zebrafish, with potential implications for broader studies of aquatic life responses to temperature variations.

## Data Description

The available Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files host a variety of data detailing the behavior of zebrafish in a constant 18°C environment. Each file includes information on the spatial series capturing the fish's headings in radians, as well as their positions within the swim lanes in millimeter coordinates. Data on temperatures at the fish positions, encompassing directional headings and positions across left and right lanes of the Gradient Behavior Chamber, are systematically recorded. Additionally, metadata covering the experiment setup, including the fish's date of birth, trial start and end times, and chamber specifications, are also stored in these NWB files.
