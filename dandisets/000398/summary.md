### Abstract

The project leverages advanced dual-side lithographic microfabrication processes to develop a state-of-the-art 1024-channel penetrating silicon microneedle array (SiMNA). This scalable technology is tailored for extensive cortical coverage and clinical translation. The innovative SiMNA features flexible backing that accommodates brain movements and is optically transparent for concurrent optical and electrophysiological analysis of neuronal activity. The SiMNA demonstrated robust recording of spontaneous and evoked field potentials, along with single-unit activities in chronically implanted mice for up to 196 days. The SiMNA provided detailed spatiotemporal mapping of broadband brain activity in rats, a significant advancement in neurophysiological investigations, promising to accelerate progress in brain-machine interfaces.

The SiMNA's multimodal capabilities and sensitivity to broadband brain activity set a new benchmark for penetrating microelectrode arrays. This innovative approach will aid in furthering our understanding of neural networks and facilitate the development of new interventions for neurological disorders. With its high-density recording capabilities and biocompatible design, SiMNA stands to make substantial contributions to both fundamental neuroscience research and clinical applications.
