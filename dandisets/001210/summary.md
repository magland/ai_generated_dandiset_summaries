### Abstract

This dataset, pertaining to the study titled "Neurovascular Coupling over Cortical Brain Areas and Resting State Network Connectivity With and Without Rigidified Carotid Artery," explores the intrinsic optical imaging (IOI) and GCaMP-based fluorescence imaging of the mouse brain. The research aims to elucidate the impacts of a rigidified carotid artery on neurovascular coupling and resting-state network connectivity across cortical areas. By employing a controlled surgical modification, this study investigates the physiological changes in blood flow dynamics and corresponding neural activity, utilizing the Mus musculus as the model organism.

The experimental design incorporates both imaging and behavioral data collection methodologies. The use of GCaMP mice allows for direct visualization of neural activity, while intrinsic optical imaging facilitates the study of blood flow changes in response to cortical activity. A LightTrackOiS200 system paired with a CS2100M camera captures high-resolution imaging data. This approach bridges the gap between optical and physiological measures, providing a comprehensive overview of the interactions between vascular and neural systems under altered mechanical conditions of the carotid artery.

### Description of Available Data

The dataset consists of six Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files, encompassing data from two subjects. Type 1 NWB files contain GCaMP IOI data characterized by fluorescence imaging, with processed behavioral data reflecting movement metrics collected via a treadmill. The structured acquisition data highlights specific imaging planes, optical channels, and camera device details. Concurrently, type 2 NWB files similarly document IOI data obtained using the same camera system; however, they excerpt red-colored images and contain acquisition metadata aligned with type 1 criteria. The dataset emphasizes precise temporal alignment, device consistency, and identical session descriptions across both file types for ensuring data integrity across experimental manipulations.
