## Abstract

The dataset "Segmented and labeled NeuroPAL structural images" comprises segmented and annotated NeuroPAL (Neuronal Polychromatic Atlas of Landmarks) datasets from the study "Graphical-model framework for automated annotation of cell identities in dense cellular images" by Shivesh Chaudhary et al. This dataset aims to provide a comprehensive view of the C. elegans neural structure, facilitating advancements in automated cell identification methodologies. The primary purpose of the NeuroPAL imaging is to aid in the development of graphical models that can automate the annotation of neuron identities within densely populated cellular images, contributing significantly to the fields of neurobiology and bioengineering.

This work utilized advanced microscopy techniques, specifically the Perkin Elmer spinning disk confocal microscope with a 40x oil objective and EMCCD camera, to capture high-resolution images of C. elegans neuronal structures. The NeuroPAL images were segmented and labeled, providing detailed cellular annotations. This dataset serves as a vital resource for researchers focusing on image processing, neuroanatomy, and automated annotation systems. It enhances our understanding of the neural architecture in C. elegans and demonstrates the potential of automated methods in handling complex biological data.

## Available Data

The NWB files contain a variety of data related to the NeuroPAL imaging and segmentation. The available data encompass:

- **Raw Image Data**: Multichannel volumetric images of the C. elegans neural structures captured using the Perkin Elmer spinning disk confocal microscope.
- **Imaging Channels**: Data from four primary optical channels (CyOFP1, Tag RFP-T, mNeptune 2.5, and mTagBFP2) used for imaging.
- **Device Information**: Metadata about the microscope used, including its configuration and capabilities.
- **Segmentation Data**: Includes processing modules that cover NeuroPAL image data and segmentation information, specifying neuron centers and their corresponding cell IDs.
- **Imaging Planes**: Detailed information on the imaging plane used for capturing the data.
- **Voxel Masks**: Data on voxel masks for each region of interest (ROI), which define the three-dimensional spatial extent of segmented neurons.
