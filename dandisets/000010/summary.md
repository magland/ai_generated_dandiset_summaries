### A motor cortex circuit for motor planning and movement

#### Experiment Summary

The experiment conducted by Li et al. (Nature 2015) aims to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying motor planning and movement in the anterior lateral region of the mouse cortex. Specifically, the study employs extracellular electrophysiological recordings combined with optogenetic perturbations to investigate neuronal activity during an object location discrimination task. This methodological approach enables precise manipulation and monitoring of neural circuits involved in motor planning, providing insights into the preparatory activity and real-time processing of movement-related information.

The experimental design involves injecting viruses carrying optogenetic constructs into targeted brain regions, followed by neural recordings during task performance. These recordings capture both the timing and quality of neuronal spikes, as well as detailed metadata on the electrodes and experimental sessions. Behavioral events and time-series data of the animals' movements, such as licking, are meticulously recorded to correlate neural activity with behavioral outcomes. The study includes both electrophysiological recordings and two-photon imaging, enabling a comprehensive analysis of both cellular and circuit-level dynamics.

#### Available Data in NWB Files

The NWB files contain a plethora of data derived from the described experiments. Key datasets include:

1. **Behavioral Events (TimeSeries)**: Time-stamped data for various trial phases (e.g., delay, go, sample) along with specific event markers such as photostimulation start and stop times.
2. **Behavioral Time Series**: Continuous recordings of behavioral metrics like tongue movement.
3. **General Device Information**: Metadata on devices like electrodes and lasers used for recordings and stimulations.
4. **Electrophysiological Data**: Detailed information about electrode placement, filtering, impedance, and individual neuron spike times, sorted by unit quality and location.
5. **Optogenetic Stimulation**: Data capturing the timing and parameters of optogenetic stimuli applied during experiments.
6. **Imaging Data**: Two-photon imaging data, including structural images and fluorescence responses of labeled neurons during task performance.
7. **Experimental Trials**: Intervals and outcomes of individual trials documented with precise start and stop times.

The acquired data extend over a variety of experimental conditions and sessions, comprising multiple files categorized by different experimental focuses.
