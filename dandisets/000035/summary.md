### Abstract

We conducted a series of Patch-seq experiments to combine patch-clamp recordings, biocytin staining, and single-cell RNA sequencing of over 1300 neurons in the motor cortex of adult mice. The data collection was performed under controlled temperature conditions (34 â„ƒ) to provide a comprehensive morpho-electric annotation of nearly all transcriptomically defined neural cell types. This dataset aims to elucidate the relationship between neuronal morphology, electrical activity, and gene expression to enhance our understanding of the functional diversity in the motor cortex.

Current clamp recordings were performed using rectangular (square-wave) stimulus protocols to evoke responses in neurons. The experimenters aimed to detail how temperature influences the electrical properties and transcriptomic profiles of neurons in the motor cortex. The gathered data include electrophysiological profiles that, when combined with transcriptomic information, could offer insights into the functional classification of neuron types and their roles in the motor cortex.

### Data Description

The NWB files consist of Current Clamp Series data acquired under the specific stimulation protocol. Each file includes multiple Current Clamp Series, along with associated metadata such as electrode information and stimulus series. The sweep tables group different PatchClampSeries together, offering structured and organized data for analysis. Key metadata fields like session ID, experiment description, institution, and session start time are also provided. The available data includes 185 cells from 8 subjects, and the data format adheres to the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) standard.
