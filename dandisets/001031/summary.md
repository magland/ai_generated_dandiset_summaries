### High-frequency (100 kHz) Rectangular Bipolar Pulses Stimulation of Individual Hippocampal Neurons: The Effect of Electric Field

This study investigates the impact of high-frequency (100 kHz) rectangular bipolar pulses on the activity of individual hippocampal neurons. Using fluorescence microscopy, researchers visualized action potentials in neurons stimulated at various amplitudes for two seconds with a 50% duty cycle. The fluorescent dye FluoVolt was employed to detect voltage changes, enabling the recording of neuron action potentials in real-time. The experiments were conducted in a low-conductance physiological solution to simulate cellular conditions accurately. This dataset provides insights into the electrical properties and response behavior of hippocampal neurons subjected to high-frequency electric fields.

The purpose of the experiment was to explore how different amplitudes of high-frequency electrical stimulation affect the activity of neurons in the hippocampus, a critical brain region involved in memory and learning. By dissecting the neuronal response to varying electric fields, the study aims to contribute to the understanding of neuronal excitability and the potential therapeutic applications of electrical stimulation in neurological conditions. The research was partially funded by NIH grant 15R21EY034803.
