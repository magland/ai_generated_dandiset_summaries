## Abstract

In this study, spontaneous transient "hypoxic pockets" in the mouse cerebral cortex were detected using GeNL bioluminescence imaging. The experimental design involved awake, behaving mice that express GFAP-GeNL brainwide. These mice underwent acute craniotomy, were administered Furimazine, and imaged bioluminescently to monitor oxygen levels in real-time. Both baseline and stimulated conditions, including whisker puff stimulation, were employed to comprehend the spatial-temporal dynamics of these hypoxic pockets.

The purpose of this research is to investigate the physiological and pathological implications of transient hypoxia in the intact brain. By leveraging high-resolution bioluminescence microscopy, the study aims to elucidate the role of astrocytes in oxygen homeostasis and identify mechanistic insights into brain responses to localized hypoxic conditions. The findings could unveil new dimensions in our understanding of neuronal metabolism and the regulation of cerebral blood flow.

## NWB File Data Description

Data housed in the NWB files include several ImageSeries and TimeSeries datasets. The ImageSeries capture bioluminescent imaging data collected in different experimental conditions, such as baseline and stimulated scenarios. The TimeSeries data encompass recordings of various timed measurements related to the clamps used during experiments. Metadata associated with each NWB file provide detailed information about the session descriptions, including subject identifiers, experimental comments, timestamps, and institution affiliations. The files also contain detailed session descriptions that provide context to the experiments, such as the specifics of the acute craniotomy procedure and the application of Furimazine.
