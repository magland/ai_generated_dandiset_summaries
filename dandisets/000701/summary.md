### Abstract

This study investigates the swimming behavior of *Danio rerio* (zebrafish) at a constant temperature of 24°C under controlled light conditions. Conducted by researchers at The Ohio State University, the experiment aims to understand the inherent thermal preferences and navigation strategies of zebrafish by observing their movement in a gradient behavior chamber designed by the OSU Haesemeyer Lab. Fifteen zebrafish, sourced from a single cohort with a date of birth on June 6, 2023, were monitored individually in a temperature-controlled environment to assess their behavioral responses and correlate movement patterns to specific temperature zones within the chamber.

The experimental setup employed high-resolution monitoring at 100 Hz frame rates, allowing for precise tracking of the fish’s positioning and heading direction within the chamber's swim lanes. Each subject was observed for a typical period, detailed by specific timestamps for session start and end times. This research provides a foundational understanding of zebrafish spatial behavior under uniform temperature gradients, contributing to broader insights into their navigational physiology and potentially aiding in the development of models for temperature-based behavioral studies.

### NWB Files Data Description

The Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files contained within the dandiset capture a comprehensive range of data detailing the spatial and behavioral characteristics of zebrafish under the experimental conditions. Key datasets include the absolute heading direction of each fish in radians, as recorded under the `CompassDirection` for both left and right lanes of the behavioral chamber. Positional data in millimeter coordinates tracks the precise location of each specimen, allowing for detailed movement analysis within the chamber's defined lanes.

Behavioral time series data documents the temperature experienced by the fish at various positions within the swim lanes, providing an integrated view of environmental conditions in relation to observed behaviors. Additional datasets categorize metadata, such as raw experimental details, chamber temperatures, and identifiers for the subjects in left and right lanes, captured under the `ScratchData` category. This collective data repository ensures robust analytical potential for researchers examining temperature gradient effects on zebrafish behavior.
