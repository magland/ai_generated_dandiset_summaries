## Mental Navigation in Non-Human Primates: Electrophysiological Study in the Entorhinal Cortex

This dataset contains electrophysiological recordings from the entorhinal cortex of two non-human primates (NHPs) engaged in a mental navigation task. The experiment was conducted to investigate the neural underpinnings of spatial navigation and cognitive mapping. During each session, subjects were presented with a start and target landmark on a screen, sampled from a linear map of six landmarks. Following a delay period, the subject was cued with a "go" signal to mentally navigate from the start to the target landmark using a joystick, while visual drift or intervening landmarks were occluded, necessitating purely mental navigation.

The primary objective of this experiment appears to be the exploration of neuronal activity in the entorhinal cortex during a spatial navigation task absent of external visual cues. The usage of 32- or 64-channel Plexon V-Probes enabled precise multi-electrode recordings. Such data can provide insight into the role of the entorhinal cortex in spatial orientation and decision-making processes. The study holds implications for understanding spatial navigation mechanisms in both normal and pathological conditions.

## Available Data in NWB Files

The NWB files encompass comprehensive metadata and detailed electrophysiological recordings. The recordings include spike times, electrode group information, and various dynamic tables covering trial intervals, behavioral data (e.g., eye and hand positions recorded via EyeLink camera and joystick potentiometer), and acquisition traces from the 64-channel Plexon V-Probe. Each trial's dataset records the time, attempts, stimulus onset, response time, and successful completions, among other attributes.

Data pertaining to units include spike amplitudes, quality classification, firing rates, and spike times. For each session, the trial intervals data elucidate the temporal structure of each trial, including start and stop times, delays, and joystick responses.
