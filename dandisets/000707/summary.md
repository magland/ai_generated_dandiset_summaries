## Abstract

This experiment investigates swimming behavior in *Danio rerio*, commonly known as zebrafish, under a thermal gradient ranging from 18°C to 26°C. Conducted by researchers at The Ohio State University, the study aims to elucidate how zebrafish respond to varying temperatures within a controlled environment. The experiment was funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under award number 5 R01 NS 123887-03. The behavioral analysis focuses on identifying temperature preferences and avoidance behavior, which are critical for understanding the thermal ecology and adaptive strategies of zebrafish. Observations were made by recording position and directional heading of the fish within a gradient chamber and were used to gauge the influence of temperature on locomotor activity.

The study used a gradient behavior chamber with precision thermal controls developed at the OSU Haesemeyer Lab. It allowed researchers to measure the responses of 16 zebrafish, each categorized under the genotype wt:nacre. Data collected include individual fish heading, positional coordinates, and situational temperature readings at their respective locations in the chamber. The analysis of these data provides insights into cold avoidance behavior, delineating crucial information on how environmental temperatures impact behavioral patterns in zebrafish.

## NWB Files Description

The NWB files associated with this dataset encompass detailed spatial and temporal records of zebrafish behavior. Each file records a full session of the experiment corresponding to a single fish in the thermal gradient chamber. Key data components include SpatialSeries data, capturing the x and y coordinates of the fish movement, and CompassDirection data, detailing fish heading in radians. Additionally, BehavioralTimeSeries data document temperature readings correlated to fish positions within the chamber over time. This comprehensive data set enables a thorough examination of zebrafish responses to environmental temperature variations.
