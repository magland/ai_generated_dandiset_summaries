## Experiment Summary

The dataset "In Vitro Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy Data - G1 and G2" encompasses electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments performed on two types of electrodes, G1 and G2. The purpose of these experiments is to investigate the impedance characteristics of different electrode contacts that vary in diameter. The study aims to provide comprehensive EIS data covering a range of frequencies to understand the electrical properties and suitability of these electrodes for future applications. This research is supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under award number 1 UO1 NS 126052-01.

The experiments were meticulously carried out in vitro by experimenter Qiwei Dong, involving a total of 8 subjects. The electrode contacts were analyzed for their real and imaginary impedance components (Z-real and Z-imaginary) across varying frequencies. Detailed metadata about each electrode, including its area, location, material, and associated group information, were recorded. These investigations may be essential in optimizing electrode design for biomedical applications, such as neural interfaces or biosensors.

## Data Description

The NWB files contain extensive datasets on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. Each NWB file includes dynamic tables that store frequency, Z-real, and Z-imaginary values from the EIS experiments. Data were recorded at 51 frequency points for each electrode. Metadata about the electrodes, such as their area, name, group references, material, and location within the subjects, are also included. Additionally, device information and session descriptions provide context to each EIS measurement session. The dataset covers different types of electrodes (G1 and G2) with various contact diameters.

The files are categorized into four types, each containing EIS data from different electrodes. For each type, the format remains consistent, storing the frequency and impedance data along with the electrode metadata. The data were created on the same date, which provides a uniform timestamp for the entire dataset.
