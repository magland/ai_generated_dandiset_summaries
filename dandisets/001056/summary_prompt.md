Below is an auto-generated summary of the contents of a Dandiset. It includes both metadata and a summary of the contents of the NWB files.

Please summarize the experiment in two or three paragraphs in the style of a scientific abstract touching on the likely purpose of the experiment.

Then give a description of what data are available in the NWB files.

Finally provide a list of up to ten keywords.

You should not refer to "Type X" since these are just internal labels used for communicating the breakdown of NWB files.

The summaries are from representative NWB files for each type, so keep that in mind when making your description. So for example, the timestamp or session ID is not going to be representative of all NWB files of that type.

Please provide your response in raw markdown suitable for copy/paste into a .md document.

description: NeuroTask is a benchmark dataset designed to facilitate the development of accurate and efficient methods for analyzing multi-session, multi-task, and multi-subject neural data. NeuroTask integrates 6 datasets from motor cortical regions, covering 7 tasks across 17 subjects.

Check out the github repository for more resources and some example notebooks:https://github.com/catniplab/NeuroTask/tree/nwb

This dataset includes:
- Spike counts per unit
- Behavioral data (hand/cursor position, velocity, force)
- Events indications
