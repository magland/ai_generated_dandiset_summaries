## Scientific Abstract

The NG-CANCAN Remote Targeting Electroporation experiment aims to refine the methodology of focused cell electroporation and ablation using a pseudo-3D model with a four-electrode array system. By manipulating the inter-electrode spacing and altering pulse parameters, this study investigates cellular responses to precise electrical stimulation. The experiment assessed cell monolayer integrity utilizing Hoechst staining, and membrane permeability was evaluated using YoPro-1 uptake, with subsequent analysis of cell death through propidium iodide staining. This methodological approach aims to enhance the precision and applicability of cell manipulation techniques in research and clinical settings, supported partly by NIH grant 1R21EY034258.

The core objective of this study was to leverage a novel electroporation technique incorporating a structured multi-pulse protocol to achieve both precision targeting and pseudo-three-dimensional control. Experiments were conducted under various electrode elevations to comprehend the effects of spatial electric fields. The NG-CANCAN protocol simulates realistic environmental conditions, allowing for repeatable and controlled analysis of electroporation-induced cellular alterations. The use of multiple fluorescence channels in imaging captures dynamic changes in cellular morphology and viability, potentially contributing to improved therapeutic modalities in fields ranging from gene delivery to cancer treatment.

## Data Description in NWB Files

The dataset comprises 84 Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files categorized into three types. Type 1 NWB files contain DAPI channel images used to assess nuclear integrity and cell identification. Imaging was conducted using an Olympus IX83 microscope, capturing the morphology of cell nuclei before pulse exposure. Type 2 NWB files provide acquisition data from the FITC channel, representing YoPro-1 uptake to evaluate membrane permeability, indicative of the extent of electroporation, recorded 30 minutes post-exposure. Type 3 NWB files capture combined Cy3 and DAPI channel data two hours after exposure, with Cy3 channel indicating cell death via propidium iodide staining and DAPI for nucleic identification.
