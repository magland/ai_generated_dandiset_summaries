## Abstract

This study titled "A Unified Framework for Dopamine Signals across Timescales" investigates the roles of dopamine signals in various temporal scales within the brain. Utilizing a combination of fiber photometry, single-unit recordings, and behavioral measurements, the research explores dopamine's functional contributions under diverse experimental manipulations. By examining these signals in _Mus musculus_ (house mice), the study aims to uncover underlying mechanisms and their impact on behavior and neuronal activity.

The experimental setup includes broad behavioral paradigms and electrophysiological approaches to capture extensive datasets. The data encompass photometry recordings showing GCaMP fluorescence changes, meticulously recorded lick times, treadmill velocities, trial intervals, and stimulus variables. This comprehensive data collection permits a detailed analysis of dopamine signal dynamics and behavioral correlations.

## NWB File Contents

The NWB files include detailed datasets capturing various aspects of the experiments. Key data components include:

- **Acquisition Data**: Lick times (Events), treadmill velocity (TimeSeries).
- **General Subject Data**: Identifier, subject metadata.
- **Intervals Data**: Detailed trial intervals with associated metadata such as reward times (rew), scene transitions (move, pause, resume), trial start and stop times, and trial types.
- **Processing Modules**: Information pertaining to fiber photometry data, specifically GCaMP fluorescence.
- **Stimulus Presentation**: Data on virtual reality track positions.
  
Additionally, the NWB files provide timestamps, session descriptions, and session start times, enriching the dataset with temporal context and aiding in the reproducibility of the experiments.
