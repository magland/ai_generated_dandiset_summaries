# Visual Cortical Activity in Mice Performing Naturalistic Virtual Foraging Task

In this experiment, mice were engaged in a naturalistic foraging task within a virtual reality environment, while large field of view (FOV) two-photon calcium imaging was employed to observe neuronal activity. Specifically, activity from layer 2/3 neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) was recorded. This experimental setup aimed to investigate the neural correlates of visual processing and decision-making in a controlled yet naturalistic scenario. By integrating behavioral and optical physiology data, the study seeks insights into how visual stimuli and task demands are encoded in cortical activity patterns.

The mice's behavior during the foraging task was meticulously documented, including trial parameters and outcomes, such as hit or miss designations based on the mice's actions. The virtual nature of the task allowed for precise control over visual stimuli and spatial parameters, further enhancing the quality of the neuronal and behavioral data collected. The primary purpose of this investigation likely revolves around understanding the interplay between visual cortical processing and behavior, shedding light on fundamental neural mechanisms underlying perception and action.

## Data Available in NWB Files

The available Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files encompass a wealth of data related to both behavioral and optical physiology measurements. Key data elements include:

- **Devices and Imaging Planes:** Information about the imaging setup, including devices and optical channels used for two-photon calcium imaging.
- **Subject Information:** Details on the subject mouse (identifier: TIGRE296_1).
- **Trial Data and Parameters:** Start and stop times for each trial, left/right position (targetx), and distance to the target (targetz), along with trial outcomes (hit or miss).
- **Behavioral Data:** Positional data of the mouse during the task, stored in the 'SpatialSeries' dataset.
- **Optical Physiology Data:** Cellular activity represented as deltaF/F (fluorescence changes over time), captured in 'TimeSeries'.
- **Session Information:** Full description of the session, including the session start time (2021-07-01T05:30:01.000000-07:00).
