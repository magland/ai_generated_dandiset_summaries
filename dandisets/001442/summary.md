## Abstract

The dataset titled "SEM Images of Rat Spinal Cord with Axon and Myelin Segmentations" features comprehensive scanning electron microscopy (SEM) data of rat spinal cord samples, primarily focusing on axon and myelin segmentations. This study aims to facilitate advancements in neuroimaging by providing high-resolution imagery that supports the development and validation of computational segmentation methods such as AxonDeepSeg. The cervical level spinal cord samples from ten different rats have been meticulously segmented to distinguish overlapping fibers, ensuring that each fiber is delineated by a single pixel border. This precise segmentation supports the assessment of demyelination and other pathological conditions, contributing to the broader field of neurodegenerative disease research.

The data set offers a unique retrospective examination of samples obtained between 2015 and 2017, showcasing small cropped sections from larger SEM mosaic images. Through applying the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) convention, the dataset is structured to promote interoperability and reproducibility within the scientific community. The SEM images provide an isotropic pixel size resolution that ranges from 0.05 to 0.18 micrometers, establishing a detailed understanding of the axonal architecture within the spinal cord sections. This repository serves as a foundational asset for researchers engaged in studying structural alterations in neuroimaging and related quantitative analyses.

## Description of Available Data

The dataset does not contain any NWB files; therefore, there is no electrophysiological data available. The focus is primarily on SEM data comprising 57 files with a total size of approximately 12.47 megabytes. These files entail high-resolution images tailored for manual and automated segmentation evaluations, supporting both methodological developments and neuroscience research. Given the dataset's meticulous segmentation, it can significantly aid in developing machine learning algorithms for image analysis in neurobiology.
