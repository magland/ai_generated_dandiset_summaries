## Scientific Abstract

The dataset under DANDI:000029 contains data from multiple experiments involving different species, including Rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta), house mice (Mus musculus), and Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus). The primary focus of these experiments appears to be the investigation of neural activity in relation to behavior and motor tasks. Specifically, the studies include extracellular electrophysiology recordings in the anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) of mice during a delay response task, as well as BMI (Brain-Machine Interface) control experiments in monkeys using chronically implanted microwire electrode arrays in the primary motor (M1) and dorsal premotor (PMd) cortex areas.

The primary goal of the mouse experiments is to characterize the neural activity of pyramidal neuron populations in relation to movement execution during a delay response task. On the other hand, the monkey experiments aim to study the cortical mechanisms of motor control using a BMI setup, wherein neural signals are decoded to control a 2D cursor. These experiments utilize advanced spike sorting techniques and behavioral paradigms to explore the underlying neuronal dynamics and their application to BMI technologies.

## Data Available in NWB Files

The NWB files provide a comprehensive array of neural and behavioral data. Key datasets include the following:

1. **Type 1:** Contains basic metadata such as file creation date, subject identifier, and session timestamps.
  
2. **Type 2:** Provides detailed extracellular electrophysiology data including electrode metadata (e.g., impedance, location), experiment descriptions, and behavioral event timestamps related to mouse ALM recordings during a delay response task.

3. **Type 3:** Similar to Type 2, this file contains extracellular electrophysiology data and trial intervals for another experiment involving mouse ALM recordings for the delay response task.

4. **Type 4:** Another comparable file with extracellular electrophysiology recordings from mouse ALM, including behavioral event data related to the delay response task.
  
5. **Type 5:** This file focuses on single-unit recordings from monkey PMd/M1 during BMI control experiments. It contains detailed Kalman filter parameters used for BMI decoding, spike counts, 2D cursor positions, and other task-related data such as target states and reward times.
