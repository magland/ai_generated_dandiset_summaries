## Abstract

This study investigates the neural encoding of visual stimuli from early visual pathways to the hippocampus in mice. Traditionally, visual cortical neurons have been shown to exhibit specific responses to simple stimuli, such as oriented bars of light. However, the exact mechanisms behind how these elementary visual stimuli are transformed into more abstract representations in the hippocampus remain elusive. The experimental design capitalizes on the OpenScope project, which seeks to elucidate the transformation of visual information as it progresses from the thalamus through the primary visual cortex (V1) and higher-order visual areas, culminating in the hippocampus and some frontal brain regions. By employing a range of visual stimuli, including both simple and complex naturalistic patterns, this research aims to unravel how the encoding of these stimuli affects neural dynamics at various stages of visual processing.

In this experiment, mice were exposed to a series of visual stimuli that varied systematically in parameters such as speed, width, and contrast. The stimuli were categorized into simple visual motions, such as moving bars of light across the screen, and more complex ethologically relevant stimuli, like video sequences of predators and prey. Key manipulations included changing the width, speed, and contrast of a vertical white bar on a black background while monitoring how these alterations impacted the processing of visual information. These controlled conditions provide a basis for understanding the neural mechanisms of visual-to-conceptual transformation, extending from basic visual input observed in V1 to more elaborate encoding observable in hippocampal and frontal regions.

## Data Description

The NWB (Neurodata Without Borders) files associated with this dataset comprise extensive electrophysiological recordings and metadata from 25 mice. These files collectively encompass a large-scale multi-electrode extracellular recording approach using Neuropixels 1.0 probes, aimed at capturing the neural responses across different brain regions. Specifically, the dataset includes raw electrophysiological signals, local field potential (LFP) data, spike times, and amplitudes for detected spiking events. Moreover, eye-tracking data capturing pupil and corneal reflection is included, along with running wheel signals to provide context for the behavioral state of the animal during the recordings. Additional data on stimulus presentation times, frame-by-frame information for movie stimuli, and stimulus configuration details are systematically archived. These data facilitate a comprehensive analysis of neural processing dynamics in response to visual stimuli.
