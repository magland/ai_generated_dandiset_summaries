# NWB Cloud Benchmarks - Zarr

## Experiment Summary

This experiment aims to evaluate the performance and scalability of storing and accessing neurophysiological data using the Zarr format in the NWB ecosystem. By deploying a representative set of electrophysiological recordings, researchers from CatalystNeuro seek to benchmark cloud-based data management and retrieval against traditional file formats. Leveraging the power of Zarr, the experiment tests the feasibility of handling large datasets efficiently, which could significantly expedite complex data analyses and collaborative research efforts.

The ultimate goal is to identify the strengths and weaknesses of cloud-enabled data storage solutions for neurophysiological data. Such insights are critical for shaping future workflows in neuroscience research, paving the way for more robust, scalable, and accessible data infrastructures. This study has implications for a wide range of applications in neuroscience, including large-scale data sharing, real-time collaboration, and advanced computational modeling.
