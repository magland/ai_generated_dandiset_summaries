## Abstract

In this study, we investigate the neuronal response to transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) stimulation on the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of anesthetized Wistar rats. Utilizing a 128-element array transducer, we applied tFUS while intracranial recordings were conducted via a 32-channel Neuronexus multi-electrode array. The experimental protocol involved tFUS stimulations with varied pulse repetition frequencies (PRFs) of 30Hz, 300Hz, 1500Hz, 3000Hz, and 4500Hz, as well as ultrasound durations (UDs) of 100µs, 200µs, and 400µs, while maintaining a constant pulse duration of 67ms. Each recording session comprised 500 trials with tFUS administered every 2.5 seconds (±10%), and the neural responses were captured and analyzed using the TDT system followed by spike sorting with Plexon Offline Sorter.

The primary objective of this experimentation was to delineate the effects of differing tFUS parameters on neural spike time responses in the primary somatosensory cortex. By systematically altering the PRFs and UDs, the ensuing data provided insights into the modulation of neuronal activity by tFUS, contributing to the understanding of non-invasive neuromodulation techniques. These findings hold potential implications for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting neuroplasticity and neural circuit dynamics.

## Data Description

The NWB files encapsulate comprehensive neural recording data from the various tFUS trials. Each NWB file contains metadata and neural activity data associated with specific session parameters. Key elements include the information about the recording device (A1x32-Poly3-10mm-50-177-A32), electrode configuration, and signals. The dataset encompasses electrode details such as filtering, group and group names, identifiers, impedance, and spatial coordinates (x, y, z). Trial intervals feature start and stop times for each trial, providing temporal context for the spike data. The units table documents the sorted neural activities with spike times across trials, structured with IDs and indexed spike times.
