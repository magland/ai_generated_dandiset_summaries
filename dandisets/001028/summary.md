# CANCAN Focusing of Electroporation in 3D

#### Abstract

The study investigated the effectiveness of a CANCAN electroporation protocol on cell monolayers using a quadrupole electrode array. Electrodes were positioned at various heights (0, 1, 2, and 3 mm) above the cell monolayer, with the primary pulse in each packet set to 6.4 kV. Each electroporation packet was administered ten times from each electrode, summing to 40 packets in total. The degree of electroporation was assessed using a 1 Î¼M concentration of the YoPro-1 fluorescent dye, which is typically impermeable to intact cell membranes, allowing for precise evaluation of cell membrane permeabilization.

The results were intended to elucidate the relationship between electrode distance from the cell monolayer and the efficiency of electroporation. By generating data on cell permeabilization, the study aimed to optimize electroporation protocols for potential biomedical applications. This research was supported by R21EY034258 from the National Eye Institute.

#### Data Description

The Dandiset includes 12 NWB files, all consisting of single time point imaging data. These files contain fluorescence microscopy images captured using an Olympus IX3 Nosepiece with a 10x magnification objective and a Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash4.0 detector. Data channels include FITC and DAPI, providing critical insight into the fluorescence imaging outcomes of the electroporation procedure. The files also provide detailed metadata about the experiment, including the configuration of electrodes, the applied pulsing parameters, and the full procedural outline as referenced in the cited study.
