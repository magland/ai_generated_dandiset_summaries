## Abstract

The study investigates the neural mechanisms underlying the integration of short-latency auditory pathways within the primary (A1) and secondary (A2) auditory cortex of the mouse. Utilizing linear probe recordings, the research focuses on responses to click and tone auditory stimuli to assess the current source density (CSD) and unit activity. This setup aims to elucidate the functional organization and information processing capabilities of auditory cortical circuits when exposed to stimuli varying in frequency and intensity, providing insights into the temporal dynamics of sensory processing.

Spanning several recording sessions, the experiments include the presentation of brief auditory clicks and pure tones across different frequency bands, systematically varying stimulus parameters to map the cortical representation of auditory information. By applying electrophysiological techniques, the study captures the spatial and temporal patterns of neuronal activity, aiming to uncover how short auditory cues are processed and integrated at the level of the individual neurons and cortical columns. The findings may shed light on the fundamental auditory processing strategies employed by the cortex, potentially offering parallels to human auditory perception.

## Description of NWB Files

The dataset comprises 94 NWB files containing detailed electrophysiological recordings from the mouse auditory cortex. The NWB files include comprehensive data sets such as intrinsic signal imaging (ISI) for visualizing frequency responsiveness at multiple kHz levels (e.g., 3kHz, 10kHz, 30kHz). For electrophysiology, the recordings are captured using Open-Ephys 64-channel Cambridge and Neuropixels probes, documenting precise electrode positions and parameters. Key datasets include spike times, electrode references, and mean waveforms for individual units, as well as trial-averaged CSD and LFP data.

Specifically, the NWB files contain data from two primary experimental setups: auditory response to clicks and response to pure tones. Click trials categorize the activity in response to discrete auditory clicks, capturing 200+ trial intervals. In contrast, pure-tone trials analyze neural responses across a broader range of frequencies and intensities, recording up to 648 intervals. The data provides high-dimensional, temporal snapshots of neural activity across the depth of the cortex, crucial for analyses of sensory processing pathways.
