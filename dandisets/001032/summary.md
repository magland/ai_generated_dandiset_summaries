## Abstract

This experimental series aimed to characterize the triggering of action potentials (APs) in neurons using sine waves and modulated sine waves at varying frequencies. Conducted on E18 Sprague Dawley rat hippocampal neurons, the study employed the voltage-sensitive dye FluoVolt as an AP reporter. Neurons were exposed to sine wave stimulation using a precisely controlled electrode setup, and responses were visualized using high-speed fluorescence microscopy. This setup allowed the capture of fast electrical events within neurons, providing insights into the neuronal response to different stimulation frequencies.

The primary objective was to understand how different sine wave parameters influence neuronal AP triggering. The experiments were meticulously designed with controlled variables including frequency, amplitude, and duration of the sine waves. These controlled exposures were synchronized with fluorescence time-lapse imaging to ensure accurate temporal correlation between electrical stimuli and neuronal responses. This approach would provide detailed temporal resolution to elucidate the dynamics of AP triggering in response to various electrostimulation conditions.

## Data Description

The NWB files contain data from time-lapse imaging acquired using an IX71 microscope with an iXon Ultra 897 back-illuminated CCD camera. The data include image series captured at 3,086.4 frames per second, with each recording consisting of 1,200 images over a total duration of approximately 388.47 milliseconds. Additional metadata such as session ID, experimenter name, subject details, and precise imaging and stimulation setups are also included. Neuron action potentials were visualized using FluoVolt in a standard physiological solution, and the synchronization between exposure and image acquisition was precisely managed using external hardware and software.
