### Aberrant Striatal Activity in Parkinsonism and Levodopa-Induced Dyskinesia

Action selection in the brain involves the coordinated activity of striatal direct and indirect pathway medium spiny neurons (dMSNs and iMSNs, respectively). Parkinson’s disease, characterized by dopamine loss, is believed to disrupt this balance. Although dopamine replacement therapy with levodopa aims to restore normal function, it often leads to levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID), which are involuntary movements that limit therapeutic efficacy. This study investigates how chronic dopamine depletion and subsequent levodopa administration affect the firing patterns of identified medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in behaving animals. Using optogenetically labeled striatal single-unit recordings, the experiment assesses circuit dysfunction in parkinsonism and LID.

Contrary to current models, the study finds that following dopamine depletion, iMSN firing is elevated primarily during periods of immobility, whereas dMSN firing is markedly and persistently reduced. Importantly, the research identifies a subpopulation of dMSNs with abnormally high firing rates evoked by levodopa, which correlate specifically with dyskinesia. These results provide critical insights into the neural circuit mechanisms underpinning parkinsonism and LID, offering potential pathways to develop more targeted therapies for Parkinson's disease.

### Available Data in NWB Files

The NWB files contain a rich dataset derived from both electrophysiological and optogenetic approaches. The data include metadata about extracellular electrodes, detailing electrode group association, channel names, and brain regions. Key datasets encompass spike sorting data, local field potentials (LFP), and detailed spike times of over 50 units. The behavioral data processed from the experiments include metrics such as distance moved, elongation, rotation, and velocity. Additionally, information about the optogenetic stimulus parameters, including stimulus amplitude and duration, is specified across 4000 experimental trials.
