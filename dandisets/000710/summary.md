## Abstract

This study investigates the laminar coding properties of visual object representations within the mouse neocortex across various contexts. Utilizing high-density silicon probe recordings, the research focuses on both the visual and parietal cortices of Mus musculus during visual object recognition tasks. The high-resolution electrophysiological data aim to elucidate how different cortical layers process and represent visual information, potentially offering insights into the hierarchical nature of sensory processing and the roles of different cortical areas in object recognition under varying conditions.

The experimental approach primarily employs an advanced multi-electrode extracellular electrophysiology recording technique, facilitated by sophisticated Intan Technologies systems. The recordings encompass an array of measures including voltage data from multiple electrode groups, providing detailed temporal and spatial information about neuronal activity. This in-depth exploration of cortical responses is expected to contribute significantly to our understanding of neural coding and sensory processing dynamics.

## Data Description

The available NWB files, created on November 15, 2023, contain extensive data recorded from an Intan Technologies system. Each NWB file includes various groups and datasets capturing different aspects of the electrophysiological recordings. Key data elements include:

- ElectricalSeries: Voltage data from amplifier recordings.
- Electrodes: Metadata and positions for a 512-electrode array.
- TimeSeries_analog_input: Analog input data.
- TimeSeries_aux_input: Auxiliary input voltage data.
- TimeSeries_digital_input: Digital input data.

Additionally, the datasets provide comprehensive metadata on the electrode arrays, including custom channel names, filtering descriptions, impedance measurements, and precise 3D coordinates within the brain. Device specifics indicate the use of 512-channel or 1024-channel RHD2000 Recording Controllers. The subject identifier (I:\VR31merged) and session details describe the context of the object recognition experiment.
