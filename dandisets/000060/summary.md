## Abstract

The study conducted by Finkelstein, Fontolan, et al., focuses on the role of attractor dynamics in gating cortical information flow during decision-making processes. Mice were trained to detect optogenetic stimulation of the vibrissal sensory cortex (S1) while extracellular electrophysiology recordings were collected from both the anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) and S1. The experimental design aims to elucidate how dynamic changes in neural activity influence sensory-motor integration during behavioral tasks that require decision-making.

Extracellular recordings were captured during sessions in which mice performed a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) task, with various trials incorporating photostimulation of S1. This optogenetic approach allowed researchers to manipulate specific neural circuits and assess how such interventions affect the ability of mice to process and respond to sensory input. Detailed data on behavioral events and electrophysiological signals were systematically recorded and analyzed to understand the underlying neural mechanisms.

## Data Description

The NWB files in this dataset contain extensive metadata and experimental data from 44 recording sessions involving a total of 9 subjects. Key components include timestamps of photostimulation events, electrode metadata, trial intervals, and detailed spike time data. Files capture behavioral events, onset and duration of photostimulation, laser power levels, and session-specific notes on data collection quality. Detailed electrode information includes impedance, spatial coordinates, and grouping. Spike data encompass unit-specific information such as spike times, cell types, electrode associations, and waveform characteristics.
