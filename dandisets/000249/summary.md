## Abstract

The responsiveness of parental animals to infant cries, and the underlying mechanisms, remain subjects of investigation. The study addresses whether the ability to recognize neonatal vocalizations is innate or learned. Specifically, it examines the maternal behavior in mice, where pup-naive virgin females initially do not recognize pup distress calls but develop this ability after co-housing with a mother and litter. Detailed findings reveal that maternal behavior is driven by a combination of intrinsic mechanisms and experience-dependent plasticity in the auditory cortex. Virgin mice are neuronally and behaviorally focused on prototypical inter-syllable intervals (ISIs) of calls, whereas experienced maternal females generalize across a range of ISIs (75 to 375 milliseconds) for pup retrieval. Intriguingly, co-housing leads to broadened excitatory responses and refined inhibitory tuning in the auditory cortex. The process, reliant on cortical activity and the hypothalamic oxytocin system, demonstrates how plastic mechanisms leverage intrinsic sensitivities for reliable parenting behavior.

## Data Available in NWB Files

The NWB files associated with this dataset include detailed calcium imaging data of the auditory cortex in experienced virgin mice. Specifically, the files contain two-photon microscopy data capturing the activity of excitatory neurons during exposure to various pup calls. The structure of these files encompasses acquisition data, imaging planes, and device information such as the microscope and multiphoton imaging system. Additionally, each file includes metadata about the session, subject, and experimental setups, providing a comprehensive framework for analyzing neural responses to auditory stimuli in the context of maternal behavior.
