## Abstract

In this study, we aim to elucidate the dynamics of neuropeptide release from presynaptic terminals using novel genetically encoded tools for in vivo imaging. Utilizing both in vitro and in vivo experimental setups, we have harnessed the potential of CYbSEP, a genetically engineered fluorescent probe, to capture real-time responses to electrical stimulations in awake animals. This comprehensive dataset provides invaluable insights into the mechanisms underlying neuropeptide transmission, potentially unlocking new avenues for understanding neuronal communication and its implications in various physiological and pathological contexts.

Experiments were conducted on Mus musculus (house mouse) and Rattus norvegicus (Norway rat) models, focusing on CYbSEP responses to defined electrical stimulation protocols. A significant component of the dataset involves acute brain slice preparations subjected to 500p-20Hz pulse stimulations, where fluorescence traces were recorded to monitor CYbSEP activity. Another set of experiments involved brain slices treated with EGTA and stimulated at 100 Hz, aimed at dissecting the calcium dependency of neuropeptide release mechanisms. The results from these studies contribute to a deeper comprehension of synaptic functionality and the modulation of neurochemical environments in vivo.

## NWB File Contents Description

The available data in the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files is extensive, comprising a total of 100 NWB files. Among these, 93 files document experiments involving CYbSEP fluorescence trace acquisition in response to 500p-20Hz electrical stimulation in acute brain slices. These files include time-series data, detailed experiment metadata, and subject information. The remaining 7 files focus on CYbSEP recordings in brain slices under EGTA treatment with 100 Hz electrical stimulation. Each file encapsulates timestamps, session descriptions, and experimental conditions, ensuring a robust framework for data analysis and interpretation.
