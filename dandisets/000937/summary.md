## Abstract

The dataset "Spyglass Demo Data" consists of experimental recordings of neural activity and behavior from rat hippocampus. The primary goal of the experiment is to understand memory and value-guided decision-making processes in the hippocampus. Under controlled conditions, extracellular voltage signals were recorded using a high-density tetrode array while the rats performed spatial bandit tasks. These recordings are invaluable for investigating the neural correlates of decision-making based on accumulated value and memory.

The neural recordings, captured via extracellular e-phys with a variety of tetrode configurations, provide comprehensive data for examining the spatiotemporal patterns of neuronal activity. Additionally, behavioral data collected from the rats while they interacted with their environment offer insights into how specific neural activities correlate with decision-making behavior. This dataset is structured to enhance compatibility with the Spyglass data analysis system, facilitating advanced analysis of complex behavioral and neural data.
