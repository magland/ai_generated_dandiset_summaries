### Abstract

This study investigates the impact of the amplitude of the second phase in electroporation pulses on the efficiency of cell permeabilization, as measured by YOPRO-1 fluorescence emission. Cells were subjected to a series of five 600 ns unipolar or bipolar pulses at intervals of 1 Hz, with the second pulse's amplitude ranging from 0% to 100% of the first pulseâ€™s amplitude. Electroporation was performed using stainless-steel cylindrical electrodes placed 3 mm apart. The experimental condition with 0% amplitude represents unipolar pulses where no second pulse is applied.

The experimental results were visualized using fluorescence staining with MemBrite dye to label all cells and YOPRO-1 to identify permeabilized cells. This method allows for the visualization of electroporated cells and the footprints of electrodes. The use of varying second pulse amplitudes aimed to assess their impact on electroporation efficiency, correlating the amplitude of the second pulse to the fluorescence signal intensity of YOPRO-1, thus offering insights into optimizing electroporation parameters for various applications.

### Data Description

The NWB files contain detailed image series captured through different experimental conditions. Each NWB file consists of composite images obtained by stitching together 144 smaller images in a 12x12 grid format. These images include data from Channel 1 (ex/em 350/460 nm) stained with MemBrite dye and Channel 2 (ex/em 480/535 nm) visualized by YOPRO-1 fluorescence dye. The data are organized by different second pulse amplitudes (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) and cover multiple sessions with files presenting sample images of cell monolayers, image series of cells electroporated with various pulse settings, and the corresponding metadata for each session.
