## Abstract

This dataset encompasses single-neuron recordings from two tetraplegic human participants attempting individual finger movements. One participant had an electrode array implanted in the left posterior parietal cortex (PPC) at the junction of the postcentral and intraparietal sulci (PC-IP), while the other participant had electrode arrays implanted in both the left motor cortex (MC) and the superior parietal lobule (SPL) of the left PPC. The recordings aimed to elucidate the neuronal activity associated with finger movements, providing valuable insights into the neural encoding of motor commands in paralyzed individuals.

The experimental setup involved intracortical recordings during both contralateral and ipsilateral finger movements. The overarching objective was likely to understand the neural correlates of attempted finger movements and to explore potential neural mechanisms that could be harnessed for brain-machine interface (BMI) applications. This study contributes to the growing body of knowledge on cortical control of limb movements and offers a foundation for developing neural prosthetics to restore motor function in paralyzed patients.

## Data Available in the NWB Files

The dataset is comprised of 12 Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files, containing detailed electrophysiological data from two human subjects. Each NWB file includes:

- Metadata about the experimental devices used (e.g., Neuroport Recording System with Utah arrays).
- Electrode group data specifying the location and properties of the implanted electrodes.
- Recorded spike times, observation intervals, and electrode groups for individual spike units.
- Experimental epoch information, detailing the start and stop times of each experimental epoch.
- Trial-specific data, including the timestamps for cues and movements, the type of finger movement cued, and whether the movement involved the left or right hand.
- Detailed extracellular electrode metadata, such as impedance values, and x, y, z coordinates.
- Session-specific metadata, such as session descriptions and start times, along with subject-specific identifiers.
