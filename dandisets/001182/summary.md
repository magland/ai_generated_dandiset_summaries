## Abstract
In this study, we investigate the stimulus-specific encoding properties of the hypothalamus during a persistent defensive state in mice. Utilizing GCaMP calcium imaging through a miniscope device, we monitored neural activity in the ventromedial hypothalamus, ventrolateral part (VMHvl), while subjecting mice to various behavioral assays designed to elicit defensive responses. The experimental setup allowed for precise behavioral annotation, capturing the timing and nature of defensive behaviors which were subsequently analyzed to correlate specific hypothalamic neural dynamics with behavioral states.

The underlying hypothesis of this research suggests that the hypothalamus, particularly the VMHvl, encodes defensive behavioral states in a stimulus-specific manner. This could enhance our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying persistent states of defense, potentially revealing novel insights into the regulation of fear and anxiety-related behaviors. Data from this study are meticulously curated and stored in the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) format for comprehensive accessibility and reproducibility.

## Data Description
The available data in the NWB files include both neural and behavioral metrics. The neural data consist of preprocessed calcium imaging traces captured from the VMHvl, specifically focusing on motion-corrected and CNMFE processed neural traces. Behavioral data are meticulously annotated, capturing processed behavioral epochs at a frequency of 11.0 Hz, with precise timestamps in seconds marking various behavioral states, including baseline intervals.

Each NWB file contains detailed metadata, including device information (1-p miniscope), session descriptions, timestamps for session start and reference, and subject identifiers. Notably, the dataset encompasses multiple subjects, totaling 15 mice, ensuring the robustness of the experimental findings. The dataset is organized to facilitate seamless access to both behavioral and neural recordings aligned with specific experimental conditions.
