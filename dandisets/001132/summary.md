## Abstract

Human hippocampal slices were used to evaluate network activity through multimodal techniques with optogenetic interventions. The primary aim of this work was to investigate the dynamics of neural networks in the human hippocampus and assess the effects of targeted optogenetic stimulation. Electrophysiological recordings were conducted to capture the extracellular electrical activity, providing insights into the neural responses facilitated by the optogenetic manipulations.

Data was acquired using a multi-electrode extracellular electrophysiology recording technique, recording the electric signals emitted by the neurons within the hippocampal slices. This study was performed at UCSF, with support from several institutions including the NIH Brain Initiative, and the NSF. The dataset encompasses 69 NWB files representing 69 subjects, offering comprehensive metadata and detailed recordings of electrical series, electrode groups, and more.

## Data Description

The NWB files contain extensive electrophysiological recordings of human hippocampal slices. The primary data captured includes the ElectricalSeries acquisition traces, which document the raw electrical activity of neurons. The files also contain metadata about the electrodes used, including their channel names, group references, and locations within the subjectâ€™s brain region. Various attributes such as electrode positions (rel_x and rel_y), the device used for recording (Maxwell version '20160704'), and the unique identifiers for subjects and sessions are included. Descriptions of the devices and techniques employed, the institutional affiliations, and project funding details are also provided.
