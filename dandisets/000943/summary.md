## Experiment Summary

This dataset, conducted by Clark and Nolan (2024), investigates the neural mechanisms underlying successful path integration-dependent behaviors in mice. Electrophysiological recordings were collected from the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) of mice navigating two different environments: a 100 x 100 cm open field and a virtual linear track. The mice participated in exploration and location memory tasks, and their neural activity was analyzed to understand the role of grid cell firing patterns in navigation and memory. This experiment aims to delineate how task-anchored grid cell activity correlates with effective spatial navigation and memory formation.

The data collection utilized tetrodes targeted to the MEC, combined with sophisticated tracking of behavioral variables. Electrophysiological signals were registered using an Intan headstage and Open Ephys acquisition board. Position and behavioral data were synchronized through data acquisition systems and processed to generate downsampled datasets. The experimental procedures involved a systematic arrangement of trials in the location memory task, including beaconed, non-beaconed, and probe trials to gauge the miceâ€™s path integration abilities. This comprehensive dataset provides valuable insights into the neural basis of spatial memory and navigation.

## Data Available in NWB Files

The NWB files in this dataset encompass a broad spectrum of data:
- **Electrical Series**: This includes the raw electrophysiological signals recorded from the MEC via tetrodes.
- **Position Data**: Captures the spatial position, speed, and head-direction of the mice throughout the tasks in centimeters (cm) and degrees.
- **Behavioral Trials**: Information on trial type (beaconed, non-beaconed, and probe), along with trial-specific behavioral metrics.
- **Electrode Information**: Metadata about the electrodes used, including their physical attributes, position within the brain, and technical specifications such as impedance and gain.
- **Device Details**: Descriptions of the equipment and methodologies used in constructing and employing the tetrodes for data acquisition.
- **Session Metadata**: Including session identifiers, timestamps, and subject-specific information.

The dataset creates a rich resource for studying neural firing patterns in conjunction with behavior, offering robust ground for subsequent analyses and modeling in neuroscience research.
