Below is an auto-generated summary of the contents of a Dandiset. It includes both metadata and a summary of the contents of the NWB files.

Please summarize the experiment in two or three paragraphs in the style of a scientific abstract touching on the likely purpose of the experiment.

Then give a description of what data are available in the NWB files.

Finally provide a list of up to ten keywords.

You should not refer to "Type X" since these are just internal labels used for communicating the breakdown of NWB files.

The summaries are from representative NWB files for each type, so keep that in mind when making your description. So for example, the timestamp or session ID is not going to be representative of all NWB files of that type.

Please provide your response in raw markdown suitable for copy/paste into a .md document.

description: The head-direction (HD) system functions as a compass, with member neurons robustly increasing their firing rates when the animal's head points in a specific direction. HD neurons may be driven by peripheral sensors or, as computational models postulate, internally generated (attractor) mechanisms. We addressed the contributions of stimulus-driven and internally generated activity by recording ensembles of HD neurons in the antero-dorsal thalamic nucleus and the post-subiculum of mice by comparing their activity in various brain states. The temporal correlation structure of HD neurons was preserved during sleep, characterized by a 60°-wide correlated neuronal firing (activity packet), both within and across these two brain structures. During rapid eye movement sleep, the spontaneous drift of the activity packet was similar to that observed during waking and accelerated tenfold during slow-wave sleep. These findings demonstrate that peripheral inputs impinge on an internally organized network, which provides amplification and enhanced precision of the HD signal.

  Group /general/devices/Device (Device) Silicon probes (Neuronexus Inc. Ann Arbor, MI) were mounted on movable drives for recording of neuronal activity and local field potentials (LFP) in the anterior thalamus (n = 7 mice) and, in addition in the post-subiculum (n = 3 out of 7 mice). In the four animals implanted only in the anterior thalamus, electrodes were also implanted in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal layer for accurate sleep scoring: three to six 50 μm tungsten wires (Tungsten 99.95%, California Wire Company) were inserted in silicate tubes and attached to a micromanipulator. Thalamic probes were implanted in the left hemisphere, perpendicularly to the midline, (AP: –0.6 mm; ML:–0.5 to –1.9 mm; DV: 2.2 mm), with a 10 – 15° angle, the shanks pointing toward midline (see Supplementary Fig. 1a–f). Post-subicular probes were inserted at the following coordinates: AP: –4.25 mm: ML: –1 to –2 mm; DV: 0.75 mm (Supplementary Fig. 1g,h). Hippocampal wire bundles were implanted above CA1 (AP: –2.2 mm; –1 to –1.6 mm ML; 1 mm DV). The probes consisted of 4, 6 or 8 shanks (200-μm shank separation) and each shank had 8 (4 or 8 shank probes; Buz32 or Buz64 Neuronexus) or 10 recording (6-shank probes; Buz64s) sites (160 μm2 each site; 1–3 M impedance), staggered to provide a two-dimensional arrangement (20 μm vertical separation).

  session_description: The data set contains recordings made from multiple anterior thalamic nuclei, mainly the antero-dorsal (AD) nucleus, and subicular areas, mainly the post-subiculum (PoS), in freely moving mice. Thalamic and subicular electrodes yielding high number of the so-called Head-Direction (HD) cells were likely to be located in the AD nucleus and the PoS, respectively. Electrode placement was confirmed by histology. The data was obtained during 42 recording sessions and includes responses of 720 neurons in the thalamus and 357 neurons in the PoS, in seven animals while they foraged for food in an open environment (53- x 46-cm).  Three animals were recorded simultaneously in the thalamus and the PoS (21 sessions). In the four other animals, electrodes were implanted in the anterior thalamus and in the pyramidal layer of the CA1 area of the hippocampus but only to record Local field Potentials (LFPs). The raw (broadband) data was recorded at 20KHz, simultaneously from 64 to 96 channels.

  Group /general/devices/Device (Device) Silicon probes (Neuronexus Inc. Ann Arbor, MI) were mounted on movable drives for recording of neuronal activity and local field potentials (LFP) in the anterior thalamus (n = 7 mice) and, in addition in the post-subiculum (n = 3 out of 7 mice). In the four animals implanted only in the anterior thalamus, electrodes were also implanted in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal layer for accurate sleep scoring: three to six 50 μm tungsten wires (Tungsten 99.95%, California Wire Company) were inserted in silicate tubes and attached to a micromanipulator. Thalamic probes were implanted in the left hemisphere, perpendicularly to the midline, (AP: –0.6 mm; ML:–0.5 to –1.9 mm; DV: 2.2 mm), with a 10 – 15° angle, the shanks pointing toward midline (see Supplementary Fig. 1a–f). Post-subicular probes were inserted at the following coordinates: AP: –4.25 mm: ML: –1 to –2 mm; DV: 0.75 mm (Supplementary Fig. 1g,h). Hippocampal wire bundles were implanted above CA1 (AP: –2.2 mm; –1 to –1.6 mm ML; 1 mm DV). The probes consisted of 4, 6 or 8 shanks (200-μm shank separation) and each shank had 8 (4 or 8 shank probes; Buz32 or Buz64 Neuronexus) or 10 recording (6-shank probes; Buz64s) sites (160 μm2 each site; 1–3 M impedance), staggered to provide a two-dimensional arrangement (20 μm vertical separation).

  Group /general/devices/Device (Device) Silicon probes (Neuronexus Inc. Ann Arbor, MI) were mounted on movable drives for recording of neuronal activity and local field potentials (LFP) in the anterior thalamus (n = 7 mice) and, in addition in the post-subiculum (n = 3 out of 7 mice). In the four animals implanted only in the anterior thalamus, electrodes were also implanted in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal layer for accurate sleep scoring: three to six 50 μm tungsten wires (Tungsten 99.95%, California Wire Company) were inserted in silicate tubes and attached to a micromanipulator. Thalamic probes were implanted in the left hemisphere, perpendicularly to the midline, (AP: –0.6 mm; ML:–0.5 to –1.9 mm; DV: 2.2 mm), with a 10 – 15° angle, the shanks pointing toward midline (see Supplementary Fig. 1a–f). Post-subicular probes were inserted at the following coordinates: AP: –4.25 mm: ML: –1 to –2 mm; DV: 0.75 mm (Supplementary Fig. 1g,h). Hippocampal wire bundles were implanted above CA1 (AP: –2.2 mm; –1 to –1.6 mm ML; 1 mm DV). The probes consisted of 4, 6 or 8 shanks (200-μm shank separation) and each shank had 8 (4 or 8 shank probes; Buz32 or Buz64 Neuronexus) or 10 recording (6-shank probes; Buz64s) sites (160 μm2 each site; 1–3 M impedance), staggered to provide a two-dimensional arrangement (20 μm vertical separation).

  session_description: The data set contains recordings made from multiple anterior thalamic nuclei, mainly the antero-dorsal (AD) nucleus, and subicular areas, mainly the post-subiculum (PoS), in freely moving mice. Thalamic and subicular electrodes yielding high number of the so-called Head-Direction (HD) cells were likely to be located in the AD nucleus and the PoS, respectively. Electrode placement was confirmed by histology. The data was obtained during 42 recording sessions and includes responses of 720 neurons in the thalamus and 357 neurons in the PoS, in seven animals while they foraged for food in an open environment (53- x 46-cm).  Three animals were recorded simultaneously in the thalamus and the PoS (21 sessions). In the four other animals, electrodes were implanted in the anterior thalamus and in the pyramidal layer of the CA1 area of the hippocampus but only to record Local field Potentials (LFPs). The raw (broadband) data was recorded at 20KHz, simultaneously from 64 to 96 channels.

  Group /general/extracellular_ephys/shank1 (ElectrodeGroup) shank1 electrodes
  Group /general/extracellular_ephys/shank1/device (Device) Silicon probes (Neuronexus Inc. Ann Arbor, MI) were mounted on movable drives for recording of neuronal activity and local field potentials (LFP) in the anterior thalamus (n = 7 mice) and, in addition in the post-subiculum (n = 3 out of 7 mice). In the four animals implanted only in the anterior thalamus, electrodes were also implanted in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal layer for accurate sleep scoring: three to six 50 μm tungsten wires (Tungsten 99.95%, California Wire Company) were inserted in silicate tubes and attached to a micromanipulator. Thalamic probes were implanted in the left hemisphere, perpendicularly to the midline, (AP: –0.6 mm; ML:–0.5 to –1.9 mm; DV: 2.2 mm), with a 10 – 15° angle, the shanks pointing toward midline (see Supplementary Fig. 1a–f). Post-subicular probes were inserted at the following coordinates: AP: –4.25 mm: ML: –1 to –2 mm; DV: 0.75 mm (Supplementary Fig. 1g,h). Hippocampal wire bundles were implanted above CA1 (AP: –2.2 mm; –1 to –1.6 mm ML; 1 mm DV). The probes consisted of 4, 6 or 8 shanks (200-μm shank separation) and each shank had 8 (4 or 8 shank probes; Buz32 or Buz64 Neuronexus) or 10 recording (6-shank probes; Buz64s) sites (160 μm2 each site; 1–3 M impedance), staggered to provide a two-dimensional arrangement (20 μm vertical separation).

  session_description: The data set contains recordings made from multiple anterior thalamic nuclei, mainly the antero-dorsal (AD) nucleus, and subicular areas, mainly the post-subiculum (PoS), in freely moving mice. Thalamic and subicular electrodes yielding high number of the so-called Head-Direction (HD) cells were likely to be located in the AD nucleus and the PoS, respectively. Electrode placement was confirmed by histology. The data was obtained during 42 recording sessions and includes responses of 720 neurons in the thalamus and 357 neurons in the PoS, in seven animals while they foraged for food in an open environment (53- x 46-cm).  Three animals were recorded simultaneously in the thalamus and the PoS (21 sessions). In the four other animals, electrodes were implanted in the anterior thalamus and in the pyramidal layer of the CA1 area of the hippocampus but only to record Local field Potentials (LFPs). The raw (broadband) data was recorded at 20KHz, simultaneously from 64 to 96 channels.

  Group /general/extracellular_ephys/shank1 (ElectrodeGroup) shank1 electrodes
  Group /general/extracellular_ephys/shank1/device (Device) Silicon probes (Neuronexus Inc. Ann Arbor, MI) were mounted on movable drives for recording of neuronal activity and local field potentials (LFP) in the anterior thalamus (n = 7 mice) and, in addition in the post-subiculum (n = 3 out of 7 mice). In the four animals implanted only in the anterior thalamus, electrodes were also implanted in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal layer for accurate sleep scoring: three to six 50 μm tungsten wires (Tungsten 99.95%, California Wire Company) were inserted in silicate tubes and attached to a micromanipulator. Thalamic probes were implanted in the left hemisphere, perpendicularly to the midline, (AP: –0.6 mm; ML:–0.5 to –1.9 mm; DV: 2.2 mm), with a 10 – 15° angle, the shanks pointing toward midline (see Supplementary Fig. 1a–f). Post-subicular probes were inserted at the following coordinates: AP: –4.25 mm: ML: –1 to –2 mm; DV: 0.75 mm (Supplementary Fig. 1g,h). Hippocampal wire bundles were implanted above CA1 (AP: –2.2 mm; –1 to –1.6 mm ML; 1 mm DV). The probes consisted of 4, 6 or 8 shanks (200-μm shank separation) and each shank had 8 (4 or 8 shank probes; Buz32 or Buz64 Neuronexus) or 10 recording (6-shank probes; Buz64s) sites (160 μm2 each site; 1–3 M impedance), staggered to provide a two-dimensional arrangement (20 μm vertical separation).

  session_description: The data set contains recordings made from multiple anterior thalamic nuclei, mainly the antero-dorsal (AD) nucleus, and subicular areas, mainly the post-subiculum (PoS), in freely moving mice. Thalamic and subicular electrodes yielding high number of the so-called Head-Direction (HD) cells were likely to be located in the AD nucleus and the PoS, respectively. Electrode placement was confirmed by histology. The data was obtained during 42 recording sessions and includes responses of 720 neurons in the thalamus and 357 neurons in the PoS, in seven animals while they foraged for food in an open environment (53- x 46-cm).  Three animals were recorded simultaneously in the thalamus and the PoS (21 sessions). In the four other animals, electrodes were implanted in the anterior thalamus and in the pyramidal layer of the CA1 area of the hippocampus but only to record Local field Potentials (LFPs). The raw (broadband) data was recorded at 20KHz, simultaneously from 64 to 96 channels.
