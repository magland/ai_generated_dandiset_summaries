# Internally organized mechanisms of the head direction sense

## Scientific Abstract

The head-direction (HD) system operates as an internal compass, with HD neurons significantly increasing their firing rates when the animal's head is aligned to a particular direction. This system may be influenced by external sensory inputs or by internally generated mechanisms, as suggested by computational models. This experiment aimed to determine the contributions of stimulus-driven and internally generated activity by recording ensembles of HD neurons within the antero-dorsal thalamic nucleus and the post-subiculum of mice, comparing neuronal activity across various brain states. It was observed that the temporal correlation structure of HD neurons was maintained during sleep, characterized by a 60Â°-wide correlated neuronal firing ("activity packet"), which was consistent both within and across these brain regions. During REM sleep, the spontaneous drift of this activity packet was comparable to during waking states but increased tenfold during slow-wave sleep. These results underscore that peripheral sensory inputs interact with an internally organized network to amplify and refine the HD signal.

## NWB File Data Description

The dataset comprises recordings from multiple anterior thalamic nuclei, principally the antero-dorsal (AD) nucleus, and subicular regions, mainly the post-subiculum (PoS), in freely moving mice. Data was obtained over 42 recording sessions, including neuronal responses from 720 neurons in the thalamus and 357 neurons in the PoS, across seven mice while engaging in foraging behavior in an open-field environment (53 x 46 cm). Multishank silicon probes recorded neuronal activity and local field potentials (LFPs) at 20 kHz, from 64 to 96 channels simultaneously. Recordings encompass sessions with simultaneous thalamic and post-subiculum recordings (21 sessions), as well as sessions with additional hippocampal CA1 pyramidal layer electrodes to capture LFPs for sleep scoring.

The NWB files contain variegated data, including:
- **Raw Electrical and Sensor Data**: Raw acquisition traces for electrophysiological recordings and raw sensor data from Blue and Red LEDs tracking subject movement.
- **Electrode Metadata**: Comprehensive information about electrodes, such as location, impedance, and group affiliation.
- **Behavioral Data**: Processed data on subject position and sleep states.
- **Extracellular Electrophysiology**: Intermediate data including LFPs and unit spike times.
