# Dandiset: 001193 - Distinct Spatiotemporal Patterns of Syntactic and Semantic Processing in Human Inferior Frontal Gyrus

## Overview

This dataset contains high-gamma (70-150 Hz) electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings from human subjects, focusing on neural activity during tasks involving syntactic and semantic processing within the inferior frontal gyrus. The data, formatted using the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) standard, is intended for reuse by the neuroscience community. The data supports the findings published in the article [Distinct spatiotemporal patterns of syntactic and semantic processing in human inferior frontal gyrus](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-022-01334-6).

## Available Data

### Electrocorticography (ECoG) Data
- **High Gamma Recordings**: Neural recordings of high-gamma brain activity were acquired through ECoG during specific experimental sessions.
- **Electrode Groups**:
  - Two ECoG grids (Grid 1 and Grid 2) were used, with detailed metadata available for each electrode, including brain region location and hardware filtering parameters.
  - Each electrode group is associated with a corresponding device, both manufactured by PMT.

### Metadata
- **Electrode Information**:
  - Location and grouping information for 256 electrodes are available, including references to the electrode group and filtering details.
  - Metadata such as electrode location within the brain, group name, and filtering specifications are provided.

### Experimental Details
- **Session Information**: Each session records the timestamps and conditions under which the high-gamma data was collected.
- **Experimenter**: Yanming Zhu
- **Institution**: Fudan University
- **Subject Information**: Detailed subject identifiers and metadata are included for each experimental session.

## Use Cases
Researchers interested in studying the neural mechanisms underlying syntactic and semantic processing can utilize this dataset for:
- Analysis of high-gamma ECoG data during linguistic processing tasks.
- Re-analysis or cross-experiment comparison with other ECoG datasets.
- Exploring spatial and temporal neural patterns within the inferior frontal gyrus.
