# Dandiset 001193: Distinct Spatiotemporal Patterns of Syntactic and Semantic Processing in Human Inferior Frontal Gyrus

## General Overview
This dataset, identified under DANDI:001193, contains electrophysiological recordings from the inferior frontal gyrus of human subjects, primarily focused on studying the neural dynamics associated with syntactic and semantic processing. The recordings were made using a high-gamma frequency range (70-150 Hz) through electrocorticography (ECoG). The data supports research findings on the distinct neural patterns linked to language processing, which are documented in a related publication with DOI: 10.1038/s41562-022-01334-6.
