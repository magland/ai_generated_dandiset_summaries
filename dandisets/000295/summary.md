## Electrophysiological Properties of Adult Mouse Spinal Cord Neurons

The experiment aims to investigate the electrophysiological properties of neurons in the adult mouse spinal cord through whole-cell patch clamp recordings. The neurons targeted in this study are specifically defined by their input-output relationships or by the expression of particular molecular markers. These recordings provide insights into the functional characteristics of various specialized neuron types within the spinal cord, which can contribute to understanding their roles in spinal cord circuitry and functions.

Whole-cell patch clamp techniques were employed to record responses from neuronal cell types. The study focused on current clamp recordings to assess the responses to various stimuli, including long square and short square current injections ranging from -50 to 100 pA in steps of 10 pA, and ramp stimuli. The collected data encompasses the electrophysiological responses from a total of 26 neuronal cells across 26 subjects, indicating a broad assessment of neuronal activity under different stimulus conditions.

## Data Available in the NWB Files

The NWB files contain comprehensive data sets for each recorded neuron, structured in several key groups. Each file includes multiple **CurrentClampSeries** groups which store the neuronal responses to specific current clamp stimuli. Additionally, each stimulus presentation and response is mapped to corresponding electrodes and devices employed during the recordings, though device descriptions are not included.

Metadata within the NWB files consist of extensive tables such as **IntracellularRecordingsTable, IntracellularElectrodesTable, IntracellularResponsesTable, IntracellularStimuliTable, SequentialRecordingsTable,** and **SimultaneousRecordingsTable**. These tables store detailed references and identifiers for various recordings, electrodes, responses, and stimuli, offering a thorough organization of the collected electrophysiological data. The dataset encompasses recordings performed at the University of Southern California's Huizhong Tao lab, led by experimenters Bo Peng and Can Tao, providing a curated and well-documented resource for further analysis.
