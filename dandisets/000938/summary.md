### Visualization and Characterization of Membrane Lesions

In this study, real-time imaging was employed to visualize individual electropores and demonstrate their persistence in electroporated cells. HEK 293 cells were cultured on Indium Tin Oxide (ITO)-coated coverslips and loaded with the Cal520 fluorescent indicator to facilitate visualization. Real-time imaging was conducted in Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent (TIRF) mode using a sophisticated Olympus IX83 inverted microscope with a cellTIRF MITICO unit and a high-resolution Orca Flash 4.0 V.3 sCMOS camera. Electrophysiological manipulations were implemented using a patch clamp set in voltage clamp mode in a whole-cell configuration. The protocol comprised a command voltage of 0 mV interrupted by a series of -50 mV pulses for 50 ms and a -400 mV pulse for 1 ms at specific intervals.

The meticulous experimental setup allowed for high temporal resolution imaging of electropores, providing insights into the dynamics of membrane lesions under different voltage conditions. This study was supported in part by NIH grants 15R21EY034803 and 1R21EY034258.
