## Abstract

This dataset comprises electrophysiological recordings from 81 mice subjected to a series of visual tasks designed to study the neural basis of visual behavior. The experiments conducted at the Allen Institute for Brain Science involved mice undergoing both associative and operant behavior training sessions. These training sessions included visual stimuli such as full-field square-wave gratings with varying spatial frequencies and orientations and natural scene images. The primary goal was to understand how visual stimuli influence neural activity and behavior, specifically looking into associative learning and operant responses in the context of visual processing.

The experiment protocols included autorewarded conditioning, where mice were automatically rewarded upon detecting changes in stimulus orientation, and operant behavior training, where mice were required to lick following changes in stimulus identity to receive rewards. The experiments varied in duration, reward volume, and complexity of stimulus transitions, providing comprehensive insights into the adaptive changes that occur in neural circuitry in response to behavioral reinforcement.

## NWB File Data Description

The NWB files contain detailed data repositories for various aspects of the experimental setup and outcomes. Key data types include time series from voltage signals of running wheel encoders, detailed stimulus presentation times, and properties for grating and natural image stimuli. The files also encompass behavioral metadata and subject information. Additionally, the data includes processed behavioral responses such as licking events, running speed, and reward delivery. Specific intervals and time intervals related to stimulus presentation and experimental trials are meticulously documented, offering robust references for analyzing neural response patterns to visual stimuli.
