### Experiment Summary

This dataset from the Allen Institute for Brain Science's MindScope Project investigates run tuning in the mouse visual cortex. Using an electrophysiological approach combined with microscopy and behavioral techniques, the aim is likely to understand how running behavior influences visual processing and responsivity in the cortex. Visual response properties of cortical neurons were assessed using two-photon microscopy and electrophysiological recordings while mice engaged in various running tasks on a rotating wheel.

The dataset involves 18 mice and consists of around 56 Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files detailing the experimental sessions. The experiments recorded neural activity, running speed, and visual stimuli parameters such as direction, spatial frequency, and temporal frequency. By analyzing this data, the goal may be to discern how locomotor activity modulates sensory encoding in the visual cortex and to map specific neuronal populations' activity patterns under different stimulus conditions.

### Available Data in NWB Files

The NWB files encompass a variety of data types and measurements. Each file may contain metadata about the device and optical channels used for two-photon imaging, details about the imaging planes and subjects, and extensive time series data tracking various behavioral and electrophysiological parameters. Key datasets include:

- **Epochs Data**: Contains vector data relating to direction, spatial frequency, temporal frequency, and timestamps of epochs during the experiment.
- **Fluorescence Data**: Processed fluorescence signals such as Î”F/F traces, raw fluorescence traces, and demixed neuropil-corrected traces.
- **Image Segmentation**: Data on region of interest (ROI) masks and segmentation metrics.
- **Running Behavior**: Metrics on the mouse's running speed aligned with neural activity and stimulus presentation times.
- **Eye Behavior**: Measurements of eye area, pupil area, and screen coordinates related to eye positions in some of the files.
- **Stimulus Information**: Timing and properties of visual stimuli presented during the session.

The data is structured within the files using hierarchical groups and datasets, allowing for detailed analysis of neuronal and behavioral metrics across different experimental conditions.
