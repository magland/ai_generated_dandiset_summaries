### Abstract
This study employs microendoscopic calcium imaging to examine neuronal activity within the supplementary motor area (SMA) and primary motor cortex (M1) in Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). The dataset is integral to the research presented in Martel et al., entitled "Microendoscopic Calcium Imaging in Supplementary Motor Area and Primary Motor Cortex of Rhesus Macaques at Rest and During Arm Movement." The objective is to elucidate the dynamic patterns of neuronal activation in these critical motor regions under different behavioral conditions, primarily focusing on states of rest and voluntary arm movements.

Neuronal calcium imaging was performed using the NVista3 miniscope system, which enabled the in vivo monitoring of neuronal populations over time. This approach generates high-resolution temporal and spatial maps of neuronal activity, contributing to our understanding of how motor commands are processed and executed by the brain. The dataset comprises recordings from four subjects, providing a comprehensive view of the variability and consistency of neuronal responses across different individuals.

### Data Description
The available Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files are categorized into two types. The type 1 NWB files include detailed acquisition data from one-photon miniscope imaging, covering aspects such as imaging planes, optical channels, and device specifics from the NVista3 system. Sessions recording spontaneous and task-related activities are documented, including processed optical physiology data like fluorescence traces and image segmentation outcomes. This includes dynamic table regions for regions of interest (ROIs) and image masks for identified cells.

Type 2 NWB files share similar structural elements but with varying session descriptions and timestamps. They also contain processed fluorescence data and image segmentation details, albeit with a different set of ROI identifiers and image masks. Both types of NWB files deliver comprehensive datasets detailing the microendoscopic calcium signals recorded from the SMA and M1.
