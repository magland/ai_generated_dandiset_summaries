# Effect of the Pulse Duration on Electroporation by Unipolar and 50% Bipolar Pulses

## Experiment Summary
The primary objective of this study was to explore the effects of pulse duration on electroporation using both unipolar and bipolar pulses. Electroporation, a technique used to increase cell membrane permeability, was applied to cells using a series of pulses with varying durations. The study utilized both unipolar pulses of 300ns, 1200ns, 50us, 100us, and 500us, and bipolar pulses where the second pulse was set to 50% of the amplitude of the first pulse, covering the same durations as the unipolar pulses. The experimental setup consisted of two parallel stainless-steel cylinder electrodes, positioned 3 mm apart, with exposures conducted at a frequency of 1 Hz.

The experiments were conducted to compare the efficiency and permeability induced in cells by different pulse durations and pulse types. Cells were stained with MemBrite dye and the membrane-impermeable fluorescent dye YOPRO-1 to visualize permeabilization. The data was collected from a well-scanned six-well plate, capturing a composite image for each test condition to assess the degree of electroporation.

## Data Available in NWB Files
The NWB files contain high-resolution images of cells that underwent electroporation. Specifically:
- **ImageSeries**: Composite images of cells labeled with MemBrite dye and YOPRO-1, showing permeabilized cells and the footprints of electrodes without electroporated cells. Each well was scanned to produce a grid of 144 images (12x12), which were automatically stitched to create the final image.
- **Subject Metadata**: Information on the experimental subjects, including unique identifiers and session specifics.
- **Session Metadata**: Details regarding the session, including session IDs, descriptions, start times, and timestamps of reference times.
- **Experimenter and Institutional Metadata**: Includes information about the researchers involved and the laboratory where the experiments were conducted.
