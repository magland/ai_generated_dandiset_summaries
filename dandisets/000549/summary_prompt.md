Below is an auto-generated summary of the contents of a Dandiset. It includes both metadata and a summary of the contents of the NWB files.

Please summarize the experiment in two or three paragraphs in the style of a scientific abstract touching on the likely purpose of the experiment.

Then give a description of what data are available in the NWB files.

Finally provide a list of up to ten keywords.

You should not refer to "Type X" since these are just internal labels used for communicating the breakdown of NWB files.

The summaries are from representative NWB files for each type, so keep that in mind when making your description. So for example, the timestamp or session ID is not going to be representative of all NWB files of that type.

Please provide your response in raw markdown suitable for copy/paste into a .md document.

description: Trains of 5 different duration pulses,  all exposures were at 1 Hz. Cells were electroporated by a train of 5 unipolar 300ns, 1200ns, 50us, 100us, 500us or bipolar 300+300ns, 1200+1200ns, 50+50us, 100+100us, 500+500us pulses (second pulse's amplitude was 50% in relation to the first pulse's amplitude). The electrodes were two parallel stainless-steel cylinders, 1.5 mm in diameter and 3 mm apart. Supported by NIH 1R21EY034258

Here is a summary of the type 1 NWB files:
  Group / (NWBFile) 
  Group /acquisition/Fig4_5_Bi100us_09 (ImageSeries) Channel1 ex/em 350/460nm and ex/em 480/535nm. All cells labeled with MemBrite dye (Channel 1), permeabilized cells visualized by membrane-impermeable fluorescence dye YOPRO-1, Dark circles with no electroporated cells are the footprints of electrodes. An image was obtained by scanning a whole well from a six-well plate, and a total of 144 images (12x12 grid) were captured. These images were then automatically stitched together to create a composite image.
