### Abstract

This dataset, referred to as "Neuropixels pulsation datasets", was collected to explore neural activity in non-human primates, specifically by recording from the primary visual cortex of macaques. Conducted by RT Raghavan at the Movshon lab at New York University, the experiment aimed to develop robust motion correction techniques for high-density extracellular recordings, a challenge in neurophysiology due to movement artifacts. The study utilized Neuropixels probes to capture the neural response to static grating stimuli with eight different orientations, helping to elucidate the visual processing capabilities and neural circuitry in primates. This work is a part of an effort to refine tools and methodologies in neural recording as presented in Windolf et al.'s upcoming paper in "Nature Methods".

The experimental setup involved creating a 5 mm craniotomy posterior to the lunate sulcus on the operculum, allowing access to the cortical area of interest. This strategic anatomical positioning facilitated detailed recordings of localized neuronal activity using sophisticated Neuropixels probes. The data generated from these experiments not only contribute to our understanding of sensory processing in the primate brain but also advance the development of motion correction algorithms essential for obtaining accurate neural recordings across species.

### NWB File Data Description

The NWB file encompasses high-resolution electrophysiological recordings captured during the experiment. It consists of acquisition traces from both the ElectricalSeriesAPImec and ElectricalSeriesLFImec, each involving 384 electrodes. Metadata associated with these recordings includes information about the electrode groupings and positions, such as channel names, contact IDs, and shapes, along with their spatial locations within the brain. The dataset also includes details about the Neuropixels device used, experimenter information, and the surgical considerations taken for data collection. Additionally, session information is provided, including descriptions of the visual stimuli presented and timestamps that reference the recording session.
