### Abstract

The dataset "20250630_AIBS_Patchseq_Mouse" from the Allen Institute for Brain Science provides comprehensive electrophysiological data obtained from whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. The experiments were carried out on slices of mouse visual cortex with an aim to investigate the intrinsic properties of excitatory projection neurons. By applying current and voltage clamp techniques, the researchers captured nuances of neuronal dynamics which are critical for understanding synaptic interaction and neuronal excitability within the visual cortex. Such detailed electrophysiological profiling can provide insight into fundamental neuronal behavior, contributing to our broader understanding of cortical function and its projection relays.

The consistent data collection method employed by utilizing sophisticated recording equipment, like the ITC18USB model by Harvard Bioscience, ensures high-quality and reproducible results across multiple subjects and conditions. The dataset comprises recordings from 422 mouse subjects, encompassing a massive repository of neuronal responses via varied stimulus protocols. This resource not only supports explorative analysis of visual cortical neurons but potentially aids in creating detailed computational models to describe diverse projection neurons' behavior.

### Data Description

The available NWB files encapsulate detailed electrophysiological recording data categorized into several domains such as VoltageClampSeries, CurrentClampSeries, and their respective stimulus series. Data acquisition is systematically organized with the use of IntracellularElectrodes interfaced with high-precision devices to measure neuronal response to both spontaneous and artificially induced stimulus sets. Each file contains structured information from multiple sweeps recording specific neuronal attributes through varied stimulus protocols, offering a broad scope for temporal and amplitude sensitivity analysis. Additionally, spikes have been elaborately detected across different sweeps, which provide crucial datasets for activity dependent and stimulus response analysis. The dataset also includes metadata for comprehensive session descriptions, methodologies, and equipment settings.
