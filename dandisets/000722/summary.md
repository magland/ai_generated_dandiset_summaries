**Abstract**

This study investigates the structural characteristics of the human somatosensory cortex using Serial-sectioning Optical Coherence Tomography (sOCT), providing high-resolution imaging of cortical vasculature. The primary objective is to enhance vessel segmentation techniques utilizing machine learning methodologies. A block of human somatosensory cortex measuring 3.4 x 2.9 x 1.1 cm was thoroughly imaged at a 20 Âµm isotropic resolution. Within this block, a smaller 6 x 6 x 6 mm region of interest (ROI) underwent intensive manual labeling of vessels to serve as a reference for validating the efficacy of automated segmentation approaches. 

The dataset generated from this investigation includes both manually and automatically derived annotations of vessels in the studied tissue block. The segmentations facilitated by machine learning are available for comparison within both the smaller ROI and the larger tissue block. This comprehensive dataset not only provides insights into the microscopic architecture of human cortex vasculature but also demonstrates the potential utility of sOCT combined with advanced algorithms for enhancing our understanding of microvascular networks within cortical structures.

**Data Description**

This dataset includes several key imaging files stored in the ome.zarr format, representing different regions and processing stages of the somatosensory cortex sample. Images of the full block of somatosensory tissue and the smaller region of interest are provided, allowing detailed examination of the overall cortical architecture. Manually labeled annotations for both tissue and vessel structures offer an essential reference for validating segmentation methods. Automatic segmentations include maximum-likelihood vessel maps and probability maps for both the large tissue block and smaller ROI, supplying valuable data for testing segmentation algorithms.
