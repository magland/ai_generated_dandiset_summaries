### Experiment Summary

This dataset comprises whole-cell current clamp recordings from human cortical neurons obtained from surgically resected tissue. The primary aim appears to be assessing the excitability and intrinsic properties of these neurons using varying protocols. The data, collected using an electrophysiological approach, likely focuses on understanding how human cortical neurons respond to different stimulation paradigms, potentially contributing to insights into neuronal behavior, disease, or therapeutic interventions.

The recordings were made from multiple cortical layers, focusing on spontaneous and evoked activity under different conditions. Each recording session captures data from neurons under specific protocols with defined parameters, providing a thorough examination of neuronal excitability across different cortical regions and conditions.

### Data Available in NWB Files

The NWB files contain a rich set of electrophysiological data, including both CurrentClampSeries recordings and CurrentClampStimulusSeries. The data comprises detailed metadata such as neuron location, resting membrane potential (RMP), gain settings, and specific protocols used during recordings. Furthermore, each file includes information about the electrodes and devices utilized, organized in a structured manner for easy access and analysis.
