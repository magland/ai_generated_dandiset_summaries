### Experiment Summary

This research investigates the functionality of dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) dopamine projections in mediating sociability and valence. Utilizing a combination of genetic, surgical, and imaging techniques, the study aims to dissect the distinct roles of these neural pathways in regulating social behaviors and affective states. The experimental design includes a habituation phase, a stimulation phase with juvenile mice, and a post-stimulation phase, thereby allowing for a comprehensive analysis of changes in neural activity and behavior across different conditions.

Mice were subjected to optogenetic stimulation of DRN cells expressing dopamine-specific markers while their behaviors were recorded and analyzed. The experiment involves viral transduction to express light-sensitive channels and fluorescent markers in targeted brain regions, specifically the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA). Calcium imaging was performed to monitor neuronal activity in real-time, providing insights into how DRN projections influence sociability and emotional processing.
