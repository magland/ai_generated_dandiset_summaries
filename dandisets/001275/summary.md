### Abstract

This dataset presents neurophysiology data collected from Macaca mulatta (Rhesus monkeys) during a mental navigation task aimed at understanding the neural mechanisms underlying spatial navigation without visual or physical movement cues. The experiments were conducted at the laboratory of Jazayeri and Fiete, MIT, with a primary focus on the Posterior Parietal Cortex (PPC) of the primate brain. The subject was tasked with mentally navigating between landmarks depicted on a screen, with intervening spaces occluded, thus requiring the subject to rely solely on mental representation for navigation. This setup allows for the investigation of how the primate brain encodes and processes spatial information in the absence of direct sensory input, potentially elucidating the role of mental simulation in navigation strategies.

The data, which is an extension of a previous study [Neupane et al., 2024, Nature], broadens the scope of research into memory and perception in mental navigation tasks. By employing techniques such as electrophysiology and behavioral analysis, the dataset captures rich neural activity data that offers insights into how primates integrate spatial and temporal cues in cognitively demanding situations. Specifically, the dataset allows for the assessment of electrophysiological signals during voluntary navigation tasks where physical reference points are not visible, thereby isolating the neural correlates of internal cognitive processes from those of simple sensory reactions.

### NWB File Contents

The NWB files contain extensive data from the mental navigation experiments. The Type 1 files include detailed metadata about the extracellular electrodes used during the recordings, alongside trial-specific data such as the number of attempts, landmarks presented, delay times, joystick responses, and success metrics. Also included is electrophysiological data capturing spike times and processed unit data, offering a comprehensive view of neural activity during task execution.

The Type 2 NWB files focus on raw electrophysiological acquisition traces, both from action potentials and local field potentials, recorded using Neuropixel probes. These files are crucial for examining the high-resolution neural dynamics underpinning the task performance, capturing data across multiple electrodes. Both types of files provide a thorough account of the spatial and temporal structure of the task, with information about device specifications, session timing, and captured behavioral data, including eye and hand positions.
