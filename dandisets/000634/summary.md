# Cell Membrane Charging by Co- and Counter-Directional ns Electrical Pulses (nsEP)

## Abstract

The study investigates the dynamic process of cell membrane charging and relaxation kinetics in CHO cells under the influence of nanosecond-scale electrical pulses (nsEP). Utilizing strobe photography with nanosecond resolution, researchers captured the transient changes in membrane potential using FluoVolt dye. The experiment employed a triangular electrode array where 300 ns pulses were alternately applied at a 1.67 MHz frequency. The precise synchronization of electric pulses and laser flashes in 50 ns intervals enabled detailed imaging of the cell's electrodynamic responses. This method allowed for a comprehensive examination of membrane behavior without causing cellular damage, providing reliability and consistency in understanding cellular responses to varying electrical stimuli.

The fluorescence data indicated enhanced signal at the cathode-facing side and suppressed signal at the anode-facing side, elucidating the directional impact of the electric field. This capability to visualize and measure membrane potential changes at such fine temporal resolution is valuable for investigating the fundamental principles of nsEP interactions with cellular membranes. This research is supported by the NIH grant 1R21EY034258.

## Data Description

The dataset includes 10 NWB files, all categorized under the same type of experimental data. Each file contains image series from strobe imaging executed with pulsed laser fluorescence microscopy. Cells loaded with the voltage-sensitive FluoVolt dye were exposed to nanosecond electrical pulses, and the resulting transmembrane potential changes were captured as individual frames. Each series represents events of 11 Âµs including 220 frames, recorded under conditions where the electrical field, pulse parameters, and timing increments of laser flashes were precisely controlled. Metadata includes details such as session ID, experimenter, institution, lab, pulse duration, repetition rate, electric field strength, and specific procedural descriptions.
