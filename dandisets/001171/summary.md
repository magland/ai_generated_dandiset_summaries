### Abstract

The dataset "Whisker deprivation triggers a distinct form of cortical homeostatic plasticity that is impaired in the Fmr1 KO" focuses on the neurophysiological effects of sensory deprivation in laboratory mice. Specifically, this study examines how whisker deprivation affects cortical plasticity, with a special emphasis on mice with a knockout of the Fmr1 gene, a model for Fragile X Syndrome. The experimental design aims to elucidate the underlying mechanisms that contribute to cortical homeostatic plasticity and to understand how this process is disrupted in the absence of the Fmr1 gene. The research utilizes electrophysiological techniques to capture and analyze neural activity in response to whisker stimulation, with the broader goal of informing therapeutic strategies for Fragile X Syndrome and potentially other neurodevelopmental disorders.

The experiment was conducted using an array of electrophysiological recordings from 62 mice, capturing the neuronal responses during sessions of controlled whisker stimulations. By comparing the responses of wild-type mice to those of Fmr1 knockout mice, the study seeks to reveal specific deficits in cortical plasticity mechanisms. The findings are anticipated to contribute valuable insights into the role of sensory experience in the development and maintenance of neural circuits, and how genetic disruptions may impair these processes.

### NWB Files Overview

The available NWB files contain detailed electrophysiological data from the experiment. Each file includes time-series data of neuronal activity recorded using a Cambridge NeuroTech H3 device. Information about the electrodes used, including their ID, label, and anatomical location, is comprehensively documented. Additional datasets provide metadata about the whisker stimulation trials, including start and stop times, velocity of stimulation, and the specific whiskers that were stimulated.

Representative NWB files include:
- Acquisition time series data
- Details about the devices used and their configuration
- Metadata of electrode groups and their properties
- Information on the trials, including timestamps and stimulation parameters
- Subject identifiers and institutional affiliations
