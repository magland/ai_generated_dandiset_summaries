## Abstract

The presented study appears to be an examination utilizing two-photon microscopy to investigate cellular activity within a population of cells. Conducted at Stanford University's Deisseroth lab, the study focuses on both raw imaging data acquisition and subsequent computational processing to analyze cellular responses. The setup includes high-resolution imaging employing a bespoke two-photon microscope, and the methodologies follow the frameworks established by modern neuroimaging standards.

The experiment's data is organized into two primary Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files. These files encapsulate a breadth of experimental data, from the recording of fluorescence signals to post-processing images aimed at segmenting cellular regions and evaluating neural activities. Each file not only includes raw imaging series but also the metadata and derived data critical to follow-up analyses, such as background images and deconvolved fluorescence readings.
