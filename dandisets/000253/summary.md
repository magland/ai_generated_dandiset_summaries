## Experiment Summary

The brain's ability to rapidly adapt to stable environments while responding vigorously to unexpected events is a central theme in predictive coding theories. Predictive coding suggests that higher-order cortical areas generate internal models of environmental statistics, leading to a prediction signal against which incoming sensory data is compared. Matching inputs are canceled out, while mismatches generate prediction error signals that propagate through the cortical hierarchy, prompting updates to internal models. To explore the circuit mechanisms underlying these processes, this study employed multi-electrode electrophysiology and optogenetics to dissect the roles of different cortical layers in feedforward and feedback signaling. Specifically, neuropixels recordings were conducted across several visual cortical areas (i.e., V1, RL, LM, AL, PM, and AM) to examine the information carried by spikes in various cortical layers during prediction error signaling and model updates.

The experimental design incorporated the Global Local Oddball paradigm, presented to mice while monitoring neural activity using Neuropixels probes. Layer-specific manipulations were achieved through optogenetics to silence top-down inputs from the frontal cortex, assessing the impact on prediction error signals in downstream visual areas. By integrating electrophysiological recordings with optogenetics and advanced analytical techniques, this study aimed to delineate the functional contributions of distinct cortical layers and regions in generating and transmitting prediction error signals, enhancing our understanding of the neural basis of predictive coding.
