## Abstract

This study investigates the effectiveness of various pulsing protocols in focusing electroporation within a quadrupole electrode array, using a specialized protocol denoted as "CANCAN." The primary aim was to determine how different pulsing sequences influence the permeabilization of cells, with the first pulse amplitude set at 4 kV in all protocols. Fluorescent dye YoPro-1 was employed to assess the extent of electroporation, as it is cell impermeable and thus only enters cells that have undergone successful permeabilization. The findings seek to optimize pulsing protocols for enhanced electroporation efficiency, potentially contributing to biomedical applications where precise cell targeting is critical.

Experiments were conducted using a 4-electrode setup, wherein each protocol began from a different electrode. The primary pulse was followed by subsequent pulses delivered at a 12.5% reduced amplitude from the preceding pulse. The pulses were delivered in packets repeated at a frequency of 1 Hz. The protocol concluded when all four electrodes had been the starting electrode at least once. This multi-phase approach aimed to provide comprehensive data on the impact of varied pulsing techniques on electroporation efficacy.

## NWB File Data Description

The NWB files contain data from single time-point fluorescence imaging using an unknown microscope setup with Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash4.0 detector and Olympus IX3 Nosepiece objective at 10x magnification (NA=0.4). The imaging protocol involved FITC channel fluorescence microscopy, capturing the effects of different pulsing sequences on cell permeability. The metadata includes detailed information about the experimental setup, session description, and pulsing parameters. Each NWB file encapsulates scanning imaging data, subject information, and session timestamps.
