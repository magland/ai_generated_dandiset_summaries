## Abstract

The primary aim of the experiment outlined in Dandiset 001337 was to investigate neural responses in the medulla/hindbrain regions of zebrafish larvae to thermal stimuli. Utilizing 2-photon calcium imaging, the study focused on areas within the hindbrain implicated in processing thermal information. By presenting hot and cold flow stimuli, the experiment sought to elucidate the cellular and neural network dynamics that mediate thermal sensation and thermoregulation in the developing zebrafish nervous system. Observing the changes in calcium dynamics provided insight into the functional activity of neurons in response to varying temperatures, thereby contributing to a better understanding of the sensory processing of thermal cues.

## Data Description

The dataset comprises five NWB files, each containing optical physiology data from different imaging sessions. Each NWB file includes raw acquisition photon counts captured through two-photon microscopy, focusing on specific imaging planes. The files encompass metadata on the imaging planes and devices, notably the OSU Haesemeyer Lab's 2-Photon setup. The processed data includes deconvolved fluorescence signals, region of interest (ROI) data for each imaging plane, and extensive image segmentation information generated using suite2p. This segmentation data consists of masks, identifiers, and probability values for each ROI. Additionally, each file records temperature stimulus presentations, enhancing the understanding of neural correlates of thermal processing. Overall, these NWB files provide a comprehensive set of neurophysiological data pertinent to analyzing the medulla/hindbrain's response to thermal stimuli.
