### Abstract

This study investigates the role of genotype differences in the neural calcium imaging of male mice, specifically comparing HIV-1 Tat negative [Tat(-)] and Tat positive [Tat(+)] groups. Utilizing a non-invasive, in vivo imaging approach, the experiment was conducted without any drug interventions to isolate the effects attributable to the genotype. The experiment primarily employed one-photon calcium imaging using a Miniscope device (NVista3) on house mice (_Mus musculus_), to elucidate variations in neuronal activity patterns associated with the different genotypic expressions of the Tat protein.

The overarching goal of this research was to enhance the understanding of how specific genotypic factors linked to neurodegenerative conditions, such as those induced by HIV-1 related proteins, influence neural activity and cellular interactions within neural circuits. The outcomes are expected to significantly contribute to the mapping of neural network dynamics, thereby facilitating better understanding and potential therapeutic strategies targeting synaptic functions disrupted by viral proteins like Tat.

### Data Available in the NWB Files

The NWB files contain a comprehensive set of data collected from the imaging experiments. The acquisition data includes Behavior camera imaging data and Miniscope imaging by NVista3, capturing detailed calcium fluorescence signals from neuronal populations. Additionally, processed data consists of optical physiology measurements, including Event Amplitude and Fluorescence data associated with region of interest (ROI) spatial footprints.

Specifically, the data comprises various datasets and groups such as PlaneSegmentation, describing cell segmentation from imaging fields, and ImagingPlane, detailing the device and imaging specifics involved in generating the calcium signals. Image masks for each ROI are included, providing a detailed visualization of cellular activity. Devices list corroborates the usage of Miniscope for imaging, recorded across eight subjects in sixteen files.
