## Abstract

This dataset encompasses multi-modal recordings of rats engaged in naturalistic foraging and rearing behaviors within an open arena. The research, conducted by Liao and Kleinfeld et al., aims to elucidate how changes in behavioral states can modulate the patterns of motor output underpinning rhythmic head and orofacial movements. By combining videography, respiration data, electromyogram (EMG) signals, wearable sensor data, and human annotations, the study provides insight into the neural and motor mechanisms that adapt to different behavioral contexts. The results hold potential implications for our understanding of motor control and its flexibility across various states.

The experimental setup involved recording 33 individual rats using a comprehensive suite of data acquisition tools. These datasets facilitated a detailed analysis of the coordination between different sensorimotor signals and behavioral states during dynamic activities. The integration of multiple data streams allows for robust cross-validation and provides a rich foundation for computational modeling of motor behavior.

## Data Description

The Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files in this dataset include numerous types of data. The primary data collected involve ImageSeries capturing rats foraging in an open arena, alongside device-specific recordings from LabChart-BNO055-Basler systems. Annotations provide detailed notes about video boundaries and behavior usability.

BehavioralTimeSeries and ProcessingModules are employed to analyze pre-defined behaviors using annotated masks. These include datasets on torso and head angles, breathing, and other raw sensor data. Additionally, these files contain time-series data on signal percentiles across 36 signal channels, processed torso tracking, and several other behavioral metrics. The dataset thus offers a comprehensive overview of the subjects' physiological and behavioral responses within the experiment.
