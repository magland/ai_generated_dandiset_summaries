## Abstract

The present study investigates the modulation of neural pathways within the cortical-thalamocortical (CTC) circuit of anesthetized rats through transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS). Specifically, neuronal activities were recorded from the somatosensory cortex (S1) and the posteromedial complex (POm) of the thalamus. This research employed a 128-element ultrasound transducer to apply varying conditions of pulse repetition frequencies (PRFs), pulse durations (PDs), and pressure levels to either the S1 or POm. The purpose was likely to elucidate how different parameters of ultrasound stimulation influence neural dynamics in these brain regions, thereby offering insights into potential neuromodulatory applications of tFUS.

To capture the neural responses, specific recording techniques were utilized depending on the target area: 64-channel electrodes for the S1 and 32-channel electrodes for the POm. Each session comprised a significant number of trials, with tFUS events spaced every 2.5 seconds, cumulating in 500 trials per recording. The experimental parameters, including the ultrasound duration fixed at 67 ms and various PRFs and PDs, are exhaustively logged. This meticulous documentation supports detailed analysis regarding how modulation of these parameters affects the neuronal activity within the cortico-thalamic network.

## Available Data

The NWB files associated with this Dandiset provide comprehensive datasets from these experiments. Each file includes metadata regarding devices and electrode configurations, specifics of the surgical and spike sorting techniques used, and detailed timestamps for each trial. Notably, this involves recordings describing the exact setup, including electrode information like coordinates and impedance. Moreover, data capturing the electrophysiological signals, such as units table and spike times, offer granular insights into the neuronal firing patterns recorded during these sessions. The inclusion of trial start and stop times also permits a temporal analysis of neural activity and its modulation by tFUS.
