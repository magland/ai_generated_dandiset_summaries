## Macaque Visual Cortex Imaging

### Abstract
This study utilizes two- and three-photon microscopy to image neural activity in the primary visual cortex (V1) and secondary visual cortex (V2) of Macaca nemestrina (pig-tailed macaque) subjects. Neurons in these regions were labeled with the calcium indicator GCaMP6s, and their responses to visual grating stimuli with varying spatial frequencies and directions were recorded. The purpose of this experiment is to map the functional organization of visual cortical areas and understand neural coding mechanisms in response to visual stimuli.

### Data Summary
Nine Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files comprise the dataset, collected from three subjects. The NWB files contain raw and processed imaging data, including TwoPhotonSeries imaging sessions, imaging plane, and device metadata. The processed data include image segmentation results from Suite2p, with manual curation identifying regions of interest and cell properties. Motion correction data and time intervals for stimulus presentation are also available. Key metrics captured include pixel masks, cell identification, and the temporal dynamics of neural responses under different stimulus conditions.
