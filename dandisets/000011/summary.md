## Abstract

This dataset investigates the robust neuronal dynamics in the premotor cortex during motor planning in house mice. The experiments involved extracellular electrophysiology recordings with optogenetic perturbations performed on the anterior lateral region of the mouse cortex while the subjects executed an object location discrimination task. The primary objective was to understand how neuronal activity in the premotor cortex correlates with motor planning and execution, providing insights into the mechanistic underpinnings of these cognitive processes.

The datasets include recordings of behavioral events, such as delays, "go" signals, and sampling periods, as well as time-series data quantifying the animal's tongue movements during licking. These rich datasets offer a detailed view of neuronal activity correlated with specific behavioral tasks, facilitating a deeper understanding of the neural circuits involved in motor planning.

## Data Available in NWB Files

The NWB files encompass a wide range of data types and metadata pertinent to the study's goals. They include behavioral event logs, time-series data for tongue movements, and detailed electrode metadata. Specific datasets within the files provide information on the hardware filtering applied to the extracellular recordings, the impedance of each electrode, and their precise coordinates within the brain.

Other datasets detail the trials' timing, outcomes, and task protocols, as well as the properties of recorded neuronal units, such as cell type, spike times, waveform characteristics, and quality metrics from clustering. The optogenetic intervention data includes time-series for laser power and aom input traces, linked to specific stimulus sites in the cortical region studied.
