## Abstract

This study conducted by the Kitamura Lab at UT Southwestern Medical Center aims to elucidate the neural circuit mechanisms associated with mirror-induced self-directed behavior by utilizing in vivo calcium imaging. Specifically, the research focuses on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) neurons in *Mus musculus* (house mouse) over the course of a five-day period of mirror exposure. Using two-photon microscopy for in-depth imaging, the study seeks to capture the dynamic changes in neural activity corresponding to behavioral responses elicited by visual self-recognition.

The investigation likely intends to enhance the understanding of how visual stimuli, reflecting self-images, modulate neural circuits involved in behavior modulation and decision-making processes. Insights gleaned from the calcium imaging data could provide a deeper understanding of the neural basis for self-awareness and the processing of self-referential information in the mammalian brain. 

## Data Description

The dataset consists of 13 NWB files recorded using the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) format, encompassing detailed in vivo imaging and behavioral data. Available data includes behavioral video recordings and high-resolution calcium imaging data obtained through an Inscopix nVista microscope. Each file contains metadata about the imaging system, which includes the optical channel, imaging plane, and associated devices. Notably, the calcium imaging data is structured within the TwoPhotonSeries, capturing the activity of neurons during the experimental protocol. The dataset covers three subjects over their respective sessions, providing comprehensive insights into both neural activity and corresponding behavioral observations.
