### Mapping the Neural Dynamics of Locomotion across the Drosophila Brain

Walking is a fundamental mode of locomotion, yet its neural correlates remain understudied on a brain-wide scale in any animal model. This study employs volumetric two-photon imaging to map neural activity associated with walking across the entire brain of Drosophila melanogaster. The investigation detects locomotor signals in approximately 40% of the Drosophila brain and identifies a global signal that is associated with the transition from rest to walking. Additionally, clustered neural signals selectively correlate with changes in forward or angular velocity. These networks span functionally diverse brain regions, including areas not previously linked to locomotion.

The data reveal time-varying trajectories of neural activity that precede future movements, representing sequential engagement of neuron clusters with different behavioral selectivity. The study suggests that these motor maps could be using a dynamical systems framework for constructing walking maneuvers, akin to models of forelimb reaching in primates. This provides a foundational understanding of how local circuits interact across large-scale networks to generate coordinated locomotion.

### Available Data in NWB Files

Data available in the NWB files encompass several types of recordings and measurements:

- **Anatomical Imaging Data**: Acquired using GCaMP6f and tdTomato markers through TwoPhotonSeries recordings, providing detailed anatomical maps.
- **Functional Imaging Data**: Captured via GCaMP6f and tdTomato, focusing on functional neural activity during walking.
- **Behavioral Data**: Includes recordings from a camera (FicTrac system) capturing the fly's movement and position, processed into various spatial and rotational measurements.
- **Motion Corrected Data**: Motion-corrected, high-pass temporal filtered, z-scored data registered into the Functional Drosophila Atlas.
- **Comprehensive Metadata**: Detailed metadata on surgical procedures, recording devices (e.g., Bruker Ultima IV, Flea FL3-U3-13E4M-C), experiment description, and session details across multiple recordings.
