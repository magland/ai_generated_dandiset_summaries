## Experiment Summary

This study presents synthetic electromyography (EMG) data derived from the MUsim repository, utilizing real waveforms from 10 motor units recorded intramuscularly. The primary focus is on examining waveform shape variability, simulating a shape noise level equivalent to 2 standard deviations. The dataset consists of 8-channel recordings over a 10-minute session with high signal-to-noise ratios (up to 200 SNR), conducted to provide insights into the impact of shape noise on motor unit recordings. The experiment was carried out with a rat subject performing locomotion on a treadmill.

The dataset aims to contribute to the understanding of motor unit dynamics and their signal characteristics under controlled shape variability conditions. Such datasets are crucial for refining algorithms aimed at EMG signal decomposition and improving the accuracy of motor unit identification. The synthetic nature of the data, combined with well-defined noise characteristics, provides a robust framework for testing and validating signal processing methodologies.
