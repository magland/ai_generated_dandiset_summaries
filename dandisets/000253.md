# Summary of Allen Institute Openscope - Global/Local Oddball Project

## Overview

The **Global/Local Oddball project** investigates the brain's response to predictable and surprising events using a predictive coding framework. The brain is thought to compare incoming sensory information against internal models, creating a prediction error when the sensory input deviates from expectations. This error signal excites lower-order brain regions and updates internal models for future predictions. The experiments recorded neural data from the visual cortical hierarchy (V1, RL, LM, AL, PM, and AM), focusing on understanding feedforward and feedback information pathways using optogenetics and multi-electrode extracellular recordings.

The dataset was collected as part of the **OpenScope** initiative at the Allen Institute for Brain Science. It includes both electrophysiological and optogenetic data, and is formatted in the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) standard. A total of 98 NWB files are available, spanning data from 14 subjects (house mice).

## Experimental Paradigm

The primary focus of the project is on predictive coding in the visual cortex, using a **Global/Local Oddball** stimulus paradigm. Recordings were made across multiple regions of the visual hierarchy to explore how feedforward and feedback signals are propagated in response to sensory stimuli. Optogenetic stimulation of top-down inputs was used to explore the mechanisms underlying prediction error signals.

## Data Breakdown

### Electrophysiology Data

- **Probes:** Neuropixels 1.0 probes (A-F) recorded from 6 regions of the brain's visual cortex.
- **Spike Data:** Contains spike times, amplitudes, waveform durations, and other spike sorting metrics for each unit.
- **Electrode Metadata:** Includes electrode location, impedance, position on the probe, and recording quality metrics.
- **LFP Data:** Low-frequency electrical activity recorded from each probe.

### Optogenetics Data

- **Stimulation Protocols:** Optogenetic stimulation targeting top-down projections from frontal to visual cortex.
- **Response Data:** Recorded response to optogenetic stimuli, including timing and duration of stimulation events.

### Behavioral Data

- **Running Wheel:** Raw and processed running wheel rotation data, providing insights into behavioral states during neural recordings.
- **Eye Tracking:** Pupil and corneal reflection tracking data, as well as blink detection, captured during experiments.
