# Dandiset 000253: Allen Institute Openscope - Global/Local Oddball project

This Dandiset includes extensive electrophysiological recordings from the visual cortex of mice, aiming to explore the brain's predictive coding capabilities. Funded by several prestigious institutions including the National Institutes of Health and the International Human Frontier Science Program, this dataset is a part of the Allen Institute's OpenScope project. The primary species involved is *Mus musculus* (house mouse), employing both optogenetic and electrophysiological approaches to stimulate and record neuronal activity.

The dataset encapsulates a comprehensive set of measurements across various modalities including spike sorting, LFP (Local Field Potential), optogenetic stimulation, and running wheel activity. Totaling 98 NWB files, it utilizes the standards of Neurodata Without Borders for structured data representation.

## Specifics of NWB Files
Each NWB file is structured to contain a wealth of detailed data about the electrophysiological environment:
- **Electrodes and Probes:** Detailed metadata for each electrode are available, including their impedance, location within the brain, and precise position on the probe.
- **Optogenetic Stimulation:** Sites and parameters of optogenetic stimulation are documented, illustrating the experimental design used to manipulate neuronal activity.
- **Running Wheel Data:** Measurements from running wheel experiments are included to correlate physical activity with neuronal data.

### Example of NWB Content:
#### Type 1 Files:
- These files focus on eye tracking, running wheel data, and general experimental setup. They include:
  - TimeSeries data related to eye tracking (e.g., pupil and corneal reflection tracking).
  - Metadata on optogenetic devices and probes used in the experiments.
  - Detailed electrode information for extracellular ephys data.

#### Type 2 Files:
- Focused on LFP data from specific probes:
  - Contains ElectricalSeries named `probe_0_lfp` with associated electrodes, detailing low-frequency components of the neural signals captured.

The remaining types (3 to 8) follow similar structures but pertain to different probes or experimental setups, each meticulously documented to ensure thorough understanding and reproducibility of the findings.

## Use Case
Researchers looking to explore neural prediction errors or those developing computational models of brain function can leverage this dataset. The detailed documentation of experimental conditions and neuronal responses provides a valuable resource for furthering our understanding of predictive coding in the brain.
