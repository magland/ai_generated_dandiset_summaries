### Long-wavelength Traveling Waves of Vasomotion Modulate the Perfusion of Cortex

This study investigates the physiological impact and spatiotemporal dynamics of vasomotion in the awake mouse cortex. By focusing on penetrating arterioles, the researchers aimed to elucidate how the oscillations in arteriolar diameter at approximately 0.1 Hz influence overall cortical perfusion. This investigation revealed that the modulation in blood flux during resting-state activity exceeded that induced by external stimuli. Additionally, the findings suggested that changes in arteriolar diameter only weakly affect perfusion, implying that the capillary bed primarily governs the hydrodynamic resistance within brain vasculature.

The study further showed that the phase of vasomotion waves evolves slowly along the arterioles, with wavelengths spanning larger than the cortical mantle, displaying sufficient variability to demarcate functional cortical areas with uniform phase. These phase-gradients enable the traveling waves to propagate bidirectionally along both pial and penetrating arterioles. The results imply that while vasomotion waves can mix interstitial fluids through penetrating arterioles, they do not support directional transport. This enhanced understanding of vasomotion could have significant implications for comprehending neurovascular coupling and brain blood flow dynamics.

### Data available in the NWB files

The NWB files encompass data collected from two-photon and wide-field imaging experiments conducted on pial and penetrating arterioles of mice. The datasets include measurements of arteriolar diameters and blood flow, phase gradients, vasomotion frequencies, coherence spectra, and cross-correlation analyses between calcium signals and vasomotor activities. Additionally, the data feature normalization parameters, joint distribution traces, and modulation depths quantified during both resting and stimulated states. The data are meticulously organized into various analysis tables, providing detailed insights into the relationship between arteriolar dynamics and neural activities.
