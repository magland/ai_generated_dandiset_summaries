## NeuroTask - Center-Out Target Task: A Benchmark Dataset for Multi-Task, -Session and -Subject Neural Analysis

NeuroTask is a comprehensive benchmark dataset aimed at advancing the methodologies for analyzing neural data across multiple tasks, sessions, and subjects. The dataset comprises recordings from motor cortical regions of 17 subjects spanning six datasets and seven different tasks. Monkeys controlled a cursor using a two-link, planar manipulandum to perform a center-out task by moving the cursor to one of eight possible targets presented on a screen. The task involved both delayed and immediate movement cues depending on the experimental condition, offering a rich variety of data for analyzing motor control and cortical processing.

The primary purpose of this dataset is to serve as a robust resource for developing and validating neural decoding algorithms and behavioral analysis methodologies. The dataset is structured to facilitate research on the dynamics of neural activity related to motor control, providing detailed behavioral and spike count data. The recordings encompass various motor cortical areas, including M1 and PMd, under different task conditions and delay periods, thus ensuring a diverse dataset for multi-dimensional analysis.

### Data Available in NWB Files

The NWB files include extensive data segmented into different modules. Behavioral data consist of hand/cursor positions, velocities, and forces, all captured in various units such as radians, centimeters, and millimeters. There are also event indications (e.g., 'Go' cues) and indices for filtering data by session, animal, and trial. Spike counts were recorded and thresholded online, then sorted offline into putative single units. These elements collectively provide a detailed account of both neural and behavioral responses during the center-out task, enabling comprehensive analyses.
