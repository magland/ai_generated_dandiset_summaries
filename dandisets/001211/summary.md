## Abstract

The experiment aims to investigate the neurovascular impulse response function (IRF) during spontaneous activity and how it varies across cortical regions in response to intrinsic neuromodulation. Utilizing wide-field cortical imaging in mice, the study observes the interactions between neuronal calcium (Ca2+) activity, hemodynamic fluctuations, and the release of vasoactive neuromodulators, specifically norepinephrine (NE) and acetylcholine (ACh). The experiments reveal that traditional models of IRF, which link neuronal activity to hemodynamic responses, fall short in predicting hemodynamic fluctuations during states of heightened arousal, characterized by increased NE levels and pupil diameter. In contrast, a regression model incorporating Ca2+ activity and NE release offers a more accurate prediction. Additionally, disparities in Ca2+ and hemodynamic functional connectivity patterns emerge during high arousal periods, underscoring the critical influence of neuromodulation on neurovascular coupling.

Findings indicate that neglecting NE modulation and the resultant vasoconstriction may result in misguided interpretations of hemodynamic coherence, commonly encountered as functional dysconnectivity in BOLD fMRI studies. These results underscore the significance of considering neuromodulatory dynamics in understanding neurovascular relationships and the broader implications for interpreting functional connectivity in neuroimaging studies. Ultimately, the research provides pivotal insights into the cell-type-specific nature of neurovascular coupling and its modulation by intrinsic neuromodulatory pathways.

## Data Available in NWB Files

The NWB files contain comprehensive data from the wide-field experiments conducted on mice, focusing on neurovascular coupling and neuromodulation. Type 1 NWB files include widefield movie data for hemoglobin oxygenation (HbO) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (HbR) using a wide-field 1-photon fluorescent microscope. The files also comprise widefield imaging data of GRAB and jRGECO signals. They provide detailed imaging plane specifications, including information on the optical channel and imaging device. Behavioral data, such as TimeSeries of body movement from accelerometry, is processed alongside optical physiology data, including regions of interest used in widefield analysis and pixel mask segmentation.

Type 2 NWB files extend upon the Type 1 dataset by including additional behavioral TimeSeries data such as pupil diameter and whisking motion energy, further emphasizing the neurovascular coupling analysis. The processing modules in these files also include optical physiology details, like image segmentation with specified ROI pixel positions and weights, supporting the comprehensive analysis of neuromodulation effects on neurovascular dynamics across different experimental sessions.
