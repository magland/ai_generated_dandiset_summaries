## Dopamine signaling in the dorsomedial striatum promotes compulsive behavior

Compulsive behavior, a hallmark of disorders such as substance use disorders, may be heavily influenced by corticostriatal circuits. This study hypothesized that dopamine, a vital modulator of striatal synaptic plasticity, plays a significant role in altering these circuits, leading to the development of compulsive behaviors defined as persistent reward-seeking despite punitive consequences. Dual-site fiber photometry was employed to monitor dopamine axon activity in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) and dorsolateral striatum (DLS) during the emergence of such behaviors. Results indicated that variability in the speed of compulsion onset could be predicted by DMS dopamine axon activity. Furthermore, amplifying the dopamine signal in the DMS hastened the emergence of compulsive behaviors, whereas inhibition of this signal delayed them. By contrast, adjustments in DLS dopamine signaling had no observable effect on the development of compulsions. Therefore, DMS dopamine signaling seems to be pivotal in controlling the development of compulsive reward-seeking behaviors.
