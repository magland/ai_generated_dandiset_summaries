Below is an auto-generated summary of the contents of a Dandiset. It includes both metadata and a summary of the contents of the NWB files.

Please summarize the experiment in two or three paragraphs in the style of a scientific abstract touching on the likely purpose of the experiment.

Then give a description of what data are available in the NWB files.

Finally provide a list of up to ten keywords.

You should not refer to "Type X" since these are just internal labels used for communicating the breakdown of NWB files.

The summaries are from representative NWB files for each type, so keep that in mind when making your description. So for example, the timestamp or session ID is not going to be representative of all NWB files of that type.

Please provide your response in raw markdown suitable for copy/paste into a .md document.

description: Compulsive behavior is a defining feature of disorders such as substance use disorders. Current evidence
suggests that corticostriatal circuits control the expression of established compulsions, but little is known
about the mechanisms regulating the development of compulsions. We hypothesized that dopamine, a critical modulator of striatal synaptic plasticity, could control alterations in corticostriatal circuits leading to the
development of compulsions (defined here as continued reward seeking in the face of punishment). We used
dual-site fiber photometry to measure dopamine axon activity in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) and the
dorsolateral striatum (DLS) as compulsions emerged. Individual variability in the speed with which compulsions emerged was predicted by DMS dopamine axon activity. Amplifying this dopamine signal accelerated
animalsâ€™ transitions to compulsion, whereas inhibition delayed it. In contrast, amplifying DLS dopamine
signaling had no effect on the emergence of compulsions. These results establish DMS dopamine signaling
as a key controller of the development of compulsive reward seeking.

  Group /general/devices/optical_fiber (OpticalFiber) Fiber optic implants (Doric Lenses; 400 um, 0.48 NA) were placed above DMS (AP 0.8, ML 1.5, DV 2.8) and DLS (AP 0.1, ML 2.8, DV 3.5). The DMS implant was placed in the hemisphere receiving a medial SNc viral injection, while the DLS implant was placed in the hemisphere receiving a lateral SNc viral injection. Calcium signals from dopamine terminals in DMS and DLS were recorded during RI30, on the first and last days of RI60/RR20 training as well as on both footshock probes for each mouse. All recordings were done using a fiber photometry rig with optical components from Doric lenses controlled by a real-time processor from Tucker Davis Technologies (TDT; RZ5P). TDT Synapse software was used for data acquisition.
  Group /general/devices/photodetector (Photodetector) This battery-operated photoreceiver has high gain and detects CW light signals in the sub-picowatt to nanowatt range. When used in conjunction with a modulated light source and a lock-in amplifier to reduce the measurement bandwidth, it achieves sensitivity levels in the femtowatt range. Doric offer this Newport product with add-on fiber optic adapter that improves coupling efficiency between the large core, high NA optical fibers used in Fiber Photometry and relatively small detector area. Its output analog voltage (0-5 V) can be monitored with an oscilloscope or with a DAQ board to record the data with a computer.
