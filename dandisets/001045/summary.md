## Abstract

In this study, we investigated the fluid dynamics within the pial perivascular spaces of rats and mice, utilizing two-photon microscopy to visualize cerebrospinal fluid motion and associated anatomical structures. The primary aim of this research was to compare the periarterial spaces across these two species, focusing on their role within the glymphatic system for waste clearance. Understanding the differences in fluid flow and structural characteristics in rats and mice may provide insight into species-specific dynamics that can influence neurological function and disease progression.

This investigation provided critical visualizations of perivascular spaces, including both dynamic fluid motion and static anatomical images. We captured both video recordings of fluid movement and high-resolution z-stacks at micron-scale increments. These experimental setups allowed for precise quantification of fluid dynamics and anatomical variability that distinguishes the two rodents' glymphatic systems, potentially offering novel insights into their respective physiological and pathological states.

## Data Description

The dataset includes 50 NWB files, which are categorized into two types. The first type comprises 33 files documenting ECG signals, movies of fluid flow, and respiratory patterns. These files offer rich time-series data capturing the physiological states and fluid dynamics in mice during experiments. The second type consists of 17 files containing z-stack images, acquired at 1-micron increments, which provide detailed structural scans of the rat perivascular spaces. These z-stacks enable researchers to analyze the spatial arrangements and dimensions of these unique anatomical structures.
