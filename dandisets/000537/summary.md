## Scientific Abstract

The dataset presents a comprehensive study investigating the fluorescence response of Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) cells that have been transfected with genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs). The purpose of this experiment is to understand the scaling behavior of GEVI fluorescence under one-photon (1P) and two-photon (2P) illumination conditions. This study aims to determine how different illumination techniques affect the fluorescence signals, thereby providing key insights into the optimal settings for using GEVIs in varying experimental contexts. By using advanced imaging and data acquisition techniques, this research offers a detailed characterization of GEVI performance in a cellular system.

Videos and other data contained in the dataset elucidate the performance characteristics of GEVIs when subjected to 1P and 2P illumination. Utilizing state-of-the-art equipment including Deepsee confocal microscopy and Optopatch cameras, the experiment captures high-resolution fluorescence dynamics. Data from this study have the potential to guide future applications of GEVIs in neuroscience and cellular biology by optimizing the imaging parameters for accurate voltage detection.
