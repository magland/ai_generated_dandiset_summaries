## Experiment Summary

This dataset investigates the neural mechanisms underlying learning and memory in a spatial alternation task. Eight male Long Evans rats were subjected to a W-Track alternation task within a single day. Each animal completed 8 behavioral sessions interleaved with sleep periods, resulting in 17 total epochs per subject. The experiment focused on the recordings from the dorsal CA1 region of the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex to observe neural activities, collect spike times, and local field potentials (LFPs) during both task and sleep periods. The primary aim was likely to understand how neural firing patterns and LFP dynamics are associated with learning and memory consolidation during sleep.

By using a combination of behavioral, electrophysiological, and spike sorting techniques, the study aimed to provide comprehensive insights into how neural activities between the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex are regulated during the encoding and consolidation phases of a spatial memory task. The approach involved multi-electrode extracellular electrophysiology recordings which are capable of capturing a large range of neural signals with high precision.

## Available Data in NWB Files

The Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files contain detailed data on various aspects of the experiment:

1. **Electrophysiology Data**: These files include the raw and processed electrical recordings, including LFP data and spike times. Each NWB file details the electrodes used, with one channel per tetrode, covering dorsal CA1 and prefrontal cortex regions.
   
2. **Behavioral Data**: Position information, including velocity, is available, tracking the rats' movements and behaviors during the task.

3. **Trial Data**: Information is provided about the trials, including the correctness of the rats' responses, start and end times, and trajectory types (inbound or outbound).

4. **Epoch Data**: Epoch intervals mark the beginning and end times of different behavioral sessions interleaved with sleep periods, allowing for analysis of how task learning is interspersed with sleep.

5. **Metadata**: Each file contains experimental metadata including the identity and specific details about the animal subjects, recording sessions, devices used, and experimental setup.
