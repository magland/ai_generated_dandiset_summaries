## Abstract

The NeuroTask dataset has been curated as a comprehensive benchmark dataset to advance the analysis of neural data across multiple sessions, tasks, and subjects. This dataset integrates recordings from six distinct studies involving motor cortical regions, encapsulating seven different tasks performed by seventeen subjects. Specifically focusing on the motor processes, the dataset encompasses spike counts, behavioral metrics such as hand and cursor positions, and various event markers. The overarching goal is to facilitate the development and validation of robust, accurate, and efficient neural data analysis methodologies.

One of the experiments within the NeuroTask dataset involved training a Rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) to perform a grasping task. The monkey was required to reach and grasp a custom-made gadget using a precise key grasp with the thumb and index finger. The experiment was conducted at Northwestern University, with neural recordings obtained from the motor cortex (M1). The dataset also includes comprehensive behavioral data, aligning physical movements with neural activity, and marking key task-related events and session-specific indices.

## Available Data in NWB Files

The NWB files available in this dataset provide detailed scientific data points, including:
- **Spike Counts**: Spike count data for various units, obtained through recordings from motor cortical regions (M1).
- **Behavioral Data**: Hand position in centimeters, cursor position in millimeters, velocity, and force metrics.
- **Event Markers**: Indications of task-related events such as go cues, movement start, task target onset, and trial outcomes.
- **Indices Data**: Filtering indices per session, animal, and trial, aiding in data segmentation and analysis.
