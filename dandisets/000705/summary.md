### Abstract

This study investigates the swimming behaviors of zebra fish (_Danio rerio_) when exposed to constant high-temperature environments. Conducted at a stable temperature of 32Â°C, the experiment aims to explore thermal preference and avoidance behaviors in young fish. These behaviors are critical to understanding the thermal ecology of aquatic organisms and have implications for their adaptation to climate change. The specific conditions in this study replicate potential environmental stressors to examine the physiological and behavioral responses of fish, providing insight into the temperature preferences that influence their habitat choice and survival strategies.

The experiment was conducted using a novel Gradient Behavior Chamber designed to precisely control the thermal environment experienced by the fish. Behavioral data, including positional and heading information, were systematically recorded to construct a comprehensive profile of fish movement patterns in response to the constant temperature stimulus. By closely observing these parameters, the study provides valuable data on the effects of temperature on fish behavior, with potential applications in ecological modeling and aquaculture management.

### NWB File Data Description

The NWB files contain comprehensive datasets generated from the experiment on zebra fish behavior in controlled thermal environments. This includes detailed positional data that capture the spatial positioning of each fish within a designated experimental chamber. The files also record the compass direction of the fish, providing insights into their orientation and directional preferences during the trial.

The data are organized into processing modules that contain separate datasets for fish behavior in the left and right lanes of the gradient chamber. Key measurements are included such as fish heading in radians and chamber position in millimeter coordinates. Additionally, temperature data at the fish's position are available, which play a crucial role in analyzing the fish's thermal preferences. Supplemental information like metadata from the experiment, including environmental temperature settings and fish identification details, further contextualize the behavioral recordings.
