## Abstract

This study investigates the dynamics of plasma membrane polarization in hippocampal neurons in response to electrical stimulation with sine waves and modulated sine waves. Utilizing a potent voltage-sensitive dye, FluoVolt, we captured rapid changes in membrane potential in response to these stimuli using advanced time-lapse strobe imaging techniques. This experimental setup allowed us to explore the time-resolved biophysical reactions of neurons to electrical field perturbations under controlled laboratory conditions. Funded partly by the NIH Brain Initiative, this research aims to deepen the understanding of neuronal response mechanics and could potentially inform future neurophysiological therapeutic strategies.

The primary objective was to observe and quantify how hippocampal neurons, pre-loaded with FluoVolt dye, react to a specific frequency of electrical stimulation. The neurons were exposed to continuous 2 kHz sine waves, as well as sine waves modulated at different frequencies (100 Hz or 154 Hz). The outcomes measured include detailed optical recordings of the membrane polarization events occurring at microsecond resolutions, thereby yielding insights into the fundamental electrophysiological responses at the cellular level.

## Data Available in NWB Files

The NWB files contain optical time-lapse recordings using strobe imaging, which provide high-resolution data of plasma membrane polarization events occurring under electrical stimulation. These recordings were made at a frame rate of 6 Hz, although the actual polarization events occur at MHz levels. This involves the use of pulsed laser fluorescence microscopy, allowing precise temporal synchronization to capture the response of FluoVolt-loaded neurons to sine wave and modulated sine wave stimulation. Each NWB file represents detailed acquisition metadata, including experimenter details, session ID, session description, and comprehensive descriptions of the experimental setup and conditions.
