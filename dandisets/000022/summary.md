### Experiment Summary

The Allen Institute for Brain Science conducted an extensive mouse extracellular electrophysiology (ecephys) experiment to investigate functional connectivity under conditions consistent with previous two-photon Brain Observatory imaging experiments. This study aimed to understand the neural dynamics by presenting a subset of visual stimuli repeatedly to mice and recording their brain activity. The experiment involved the measurement of neural responses to various visual stimuli, including drifting gratings, gabors, natural movies, and dot motion, in order to elucidate the underlying functional connectivity in the brain.

Extracellular electrophysiological recordings, along with eye tracking and running wheel data, were collected from 26 mice using multiple probes. These recordings were done to capture both spontaneous and stimulus-evoked neural activity. The data collected will contribute to the broader goal of mapping brain circuits and understanding visual coding and neural connectivity.

### NWB Files Data Description

The NWB files contain detailed extracellular electrophysiology data along with metadata about the experimental setup. Each file includes acquisition data such as raw running wheel rotation, signal voltage, and supply voltage. Additionally, metadata on extracellular electrode groups, probe characteristics, and electrode positions are provided. Specific NWB files include local field potential (LFP) recordings from individual probes along with current source density (CSD) analysis. Information about the visual stimuli presentations is also meticulously documented, covering attributes like stimulus type, orientation, contrast, spatial and temporal frequency, and timings.

Eye tracking data consist of center positions, heights, widths, and the angular orientation of the pupil and corneal reflections. A comprehensive set of time series data captures various stimulus intervals, running speed, and optogenetic stimulation details. Finally, the 'units' section of the NWB file includes various metrics for the recorded neuronal units such as firing rates, spike times, waveforms, and quality metrics.
