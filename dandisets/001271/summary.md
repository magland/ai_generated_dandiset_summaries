### Abstract

Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a potent sodium channel blocker that is widely used to explore the role of sodium channels in neural excitability and action potential formation. The dataset titled "Tetrodotoxin Blockade of Sodium Channels Abolishes Action Potential Formation During Intense Sinewave Stimulation" investigates the capability of TTX to inhibit action potentials during intense sinewave electrical stimulation in neural tissues. By applying 1 ÂµM TTX, researchers were able to effectively suppress action potential firing and prevent sustained depolarization, highlighting the critical role of sodium channel activity under these experimental conditions. This study contributes to the understanding of sodium channel dynamics and the mechanisms through which TTX affects neural activity, with the support of funding from the NIH Brain Initiative.

The experiments were conducted on Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) using voltage-sensitive fluorescent dyes to visualize action potentials. The stimulation protocol involved applying a 250ms-long sine wave at 2kHz with a nominal amplitude of 3.5V, which was designed to provoke robust neural responses. The experiments were conducted both with and without TTX to assess its effects on neural activity comprehensively. Results from this study are anticipated to provide deeper insights into the modulation of action potentials and the functionality of sodium channels, potentially informing therapeutic strategies for neurologically related conditions.

### NWB Data Description

The Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files contain comprehensive experimental data from the study, with a total of 100 files included in the dataset. The data are representative of neural responses to sinewave stimulation in the presence and absence of TTX. Specifically, the NWB files include time-lapse imaging series captured during the experiments, which were conducted in a controlled physiological solution. Detailed metadata, such as the experimenter, session start time, and session descriptions, are also present in the files, alongside subject-specific information like the subject ID and experimental parameters. This dataset offers a rich resource for examining the effects of TTX at a detailed level, structured to facilitate easy exploration and analysis by researchers.
