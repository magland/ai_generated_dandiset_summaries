Below is an auto-generated summary of the contents of a Dandiset. It includes both metadata and a summary of the contents of the NWB files.

Please summarize the experiment in two or three paragraphs in the style of a scientific abstract touching on the likely purpose of the experiment.

Then give a description of what data are available in the NWB files.

Finally provide a list of up to ten keywords.

You should not refer to "Type X" since these are just internal labels used for communicating the breakdown of NWB files.

The summaries are from representative NWB files for each type, so keep that in mind when making your description. So for example, the timestamp or session ID is not going to be representative of all NWB files of that type.

Please provide your response in raw markdown suitable for copy/paste into a .md document.

description: This dataset explores whether blocking sodium channels with tetrodotoxin (TTX) can prevent action potential formation during intense sinewave stimulation. Applying 1 ÂµM TTX suppressed action potentials, as expected, and completely prevented sustained depolarization. This study was partially supported by the NIH Brain Initiative (NEI R21EY034803).

Dandiset 001271 has 100 NWB files.
100 of these NWB files are of type 1.


Here is a summary of the type 1 NWB files:
  Group / (NWBFile) 
  Group /acquisition/TimeLapseImaging (ImageSeries) Subject ID: 10_20240731. Stimulation was applied with a 250ms-long sine wave at 2kHz with 3.5V amplitude. The experiment was performed without tetrodotoxin (vehicle control). Note: Actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope may be smaller due to calibration factors. For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates to 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg).
