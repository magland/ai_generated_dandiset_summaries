# Experiment Overview

The dataset comprises electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data acquired in vitro using G2 electrodes. This research, supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), aims to generate accuracy contour plots for multiple electrode configurations, crucial for validating electrode performance metrics. The project involves multiple sessions where the impedance values of electrodes are measured under various conditions, enabling precise characterization of the electrodes' electrochemical properties.

The EIS experiments were conducted using a Potentiostatic EIS setup involving the GAMRY device. Each session recorded frequency-dependent impedance data, including real and imaginary components, across different electrode configurations and environmental conditions. This stringent examination of electrodes supports deeper insights into their reliability and potential applications in biomedical devices.
