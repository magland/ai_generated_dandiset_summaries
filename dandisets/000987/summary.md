## Freely Moving Mouse Retrosplenial Cortex Recordings

This dataset encompasses electrophysiological and behavioral recordings from the retrosplenial cortex of three mice, collected over multiple sessions to analyze neuronal activity patterns. The aim of this study, as detailed in the publication "Hyperpolarization-Activated Currents Drive Neuronal Activation Sequences in Sleep," was to understand the role of hyperpolarization-activated currents in driving neuronal activation sequences during sleep and exploration. The dataset includes 14 separate recordings yielding a total of 570 isolated units. Each recording session involved structured periods of open field exploration and sleep, enabling the examination of neuronal activities under different behavioral states.

The experiment was designed to capture detailed electrophysiological data, including local field potentials (LFP), alongside animal positional coordinates and head-direction data. The sessions alternated between active exploration in various environments (circular and square arenas) and sleep intervals in the home cage, thus providing a comprehensive dataset for studying the interaction between sleep states and behaviorally relevant neuronal activities. Essential data elements such as detected UP and DOWN states, sleep scoring (REM/NREM), and spike times for isolated units were also recorded.

### Data Available in the NWB Files

The NWB files contain the following types of data:
- **Spike Times and Units**: Timestamps of detected units and information about the electrode groups they were recorded from.
- **Local Field Potentials (LFP)**: Recorded from a 64-channel or 8-shank silicon probe.
- **Animal Position and Head-Direction**: Recorded positional data (x, y, z coordinates) and compass direction series.
- **Sleep Scoring**: Data on REM/NREM states and detected UP and DOWN states throughout the sessions.
- **Experimental Epochs and Intervals**: Detailed start and stop times of different behavioral and sleep epochs, and user-defined tags.
