## Abstract

Much of sensory neuroscience has focused on how the brain faithfully represents sensory information. However, sensory information is often incomplete and ambiguous, necessitating the brain to rely on internal models to infer a coherent percept. Investigating how these internal models operate can be highly informative, particularly through the study of perceptual illusions. This project utilizes illusory contours (ICs) to elucidate the microcircuit mechanisms underlying perceptual inference of an edge. ICs have been observed in multiple species, including mice, and neurons that respond to ICs demonstrate similar receptive fields and feature selectivity as those responding to real edges, despite lacking feedforward sensory drive.

The primary goal of this experiment was to determine how neocortical microcircuits generate illusory responses in IC encoders and whether this encoding mechanism is consistent across the visual cortical hierarchy. Using electrophysiological and optogenetic approaches, the study gathered data from murine models to identify neural correlates of IC perception. These insights aim to improve our understanding of the brain's internal model for sensory processing under ambiguous conditions.

## NWB File Contents

The NWB files contain a wide array of data types essential for comprehending the neurophysiological basis of illusory contour perception:

1. **Electrophysiological Data**: Includes recordings from Neuropixels 1.0 probes, capturing data on electrical activity from thousands of extracellular electrodes, covering details like impedance, position, and validity of the recorded data.
2. **Optogenetic Data**: Provides information on optogenetic stimulation, including details about the stimuli used and time intervals for each presentation.
3. **LFP Data**: Local field potential (LFP) recordings across multiple probes, with metadata about electrode groups and the specifics of data filtering and recording conditions.
4. **Running Wheel Data**: Measurements of the mouse's running wheel rotation, signal voltage, and supply voltage.
5. **Eye-Tracking Data**: Ellipse-based eye-tracking data capturing pupil, corneal reflection, and likely blink instances.
6. **Stimuli Presentations**: Rich metadata on stimuli details and presentation intervals for different movie configurations depicting illusory contours.
7. **Spike Sorting Data**: Comprehensive details on spike times, amplitudes, and other spike sorting metrics for neural activity recorded during the experiments.
   
Each file is meticulously documented with creation dates, detailed descriptions of each dataset, and specific identifiers for the session and stimuli, enabling thorough analysis and reproducibility of the findings.
