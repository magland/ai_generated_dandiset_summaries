# Long-term recordings of motor and premotor cortical spiking activity during reaching in monkeys

This study investigates the neural mechanisms underlying motor control during reaching tasks by recording spiking activity in the primary motor cortex (M1) and the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) of rhesus macaque monkeys. The experiments involved tasks such as center-out reaching and continuous random target acquisition, requiring precise motor coordination. The analyses focus on understanding how motor commands are represented in cortical neurons during various stages of movement.

Neural data were collected using chronically implanted 96-electrode Utah arrays, enabling long-term extracellular recording. The dataset encompasses a wide range of behavioral conditions and task-related metadata, including cursor position and velocity. Spike sorting was manually performed for three subjects, while another subject's data include threshold crossings. This extensive dataset is intended to provide insights into the motor cortex's role in motor planning and execution.

## Data Description

The dataset includes 100 NWB files divided into four main categories. Each file contains detailed metadata about the experimental setup, including neural data obtained from up to 192 electrodes per session. Metadata include device descriptions, electrode group details, and filtering information. Behavioral data such as trial outcomes, start and stop times, and target information (location, direction, size) are also available. The data are further processed to include cursor position, velocity, and acceleration, and there are tables identifying units and their spike times and waveforms.
