## Neural Spiking Data in Primary Somatosensory Cortex before and after Transcranial Focused Ultrasound Stimulation in Rats

Transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS) has emerged as a powerful tool for neuromodulation, offering non-invasive techniques to alter neural activity. In this study, researchers investigated how tFUS modulates neural interactions and responses to peripheral electrical limb stimulation through intracranial multi-electrode recordings in the rat somatosensory cortex. Utilizing isoflurane anesthesia, neural activity in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1HL region) was recorded before and after ultrasound application. Peripheral electrical stimulation was delivered every 5 seconds to assess neural responses under both true and sham ultrasound conditions. Ultrasound was applied in a pulsed pattern for 5 minutes at varying stimulus repetition frequencies to induce frequency-dependent plasticity, analogous to effects observed following tetanic electrical stimulation.

The experimental protocol involved specific ultrasound parameters including a 0.5 MHz fundamental frequency, 3 kHz pulse repetition frequency (PRF), and a 36% duty cycle. By delivering these stimuli, researchers aimed to understand the mechanisms through which tFUS induces changes in neural plasticity. The results can provide insight into how ultrasound can be finely tuned to achieve desired neuromodulatory effects. This research has implications for developing new strategies for treating neurological disorders and enhancing our understanding of brain plasticity.

### Available Data in NWB Files

The Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files encompass extensive datasets with neural spike timings recorded before and after tFUS application. Each file includes neuron identifier information, detailed session descriptions, and a variety of attributes associated with the experimental conditions. Specifically, the data includes:
- General subject information including identifiers and session start times
- Units table containing spike timing data for each recorded unit
- Details of spike sorting techniques and methodologies applied in the analysis

Researchers utilizing this dataset will find spike times with high temporal precision, enabling extensive analysis of neural activity changes induced by tFUS.
