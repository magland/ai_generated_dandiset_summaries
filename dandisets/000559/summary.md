# Spontaneous Behaviour is Structured by Reinforcement without Explicit Reward

## Abstract
Spontaneous animal behavior consists of action modules that the brain concatenates into sequences. The neural mechanisms guiding the composition of such naturalistic, self-motivated behaviors remain uncertain. In this study, we demonstrate that dopamine fluctuations in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) occur as mice spontaneously exhibit sub-second behavioral modules, even without task structure, sensory cues, or exogenous rewards. Using photometric recordings and calibrated closed-loop optogenetic manipulations during open field behavior, it was observed that these dopamine fluctuations increase sequence variation over seconds, reinforce the use of associated behavioral modules over minutes, and modulate the vigor with which these modules are expressed.

Interestingly, while optogenetic DLS dopamine manipulations' reinforcing effects vary across behavioral modules and individual mice, these differences are well-predicted by endogenous dopamine and module use relationships. This observation aligns with the hypothesis that DLS dopamine fluctuations act as a teaching signal, as mice construct sequences during exploration seemingly to maximize dopamine. These findings propose a model where the neural circuits and computations responsible for action choices in structured tasks play a crucial role in shaping the content of high-dimensional, spontaneous behavior.

## Available Data
The NWB files available in this dataset contain numerous forms of data related to the experiment. Key data include depth video recordings of mouse behavior acquired at 30Hz using a Kinect 2 device and processed behavioral data from the Motion Sequencing (MoSeq) system. There are labeled events identifying behavioral syllables both online and offline. Time series data detailing the angular velocity, position, area, speed, and other kinematic measures of the mice in the open field are provided. Additionally, these files contain optogenetic stimulation data, including onset and offset timestamps of the stimulation. The dataset from Harvard Medical School includes a total of 100 NWB files, documenting comprehensive experimental conditions and findings.
