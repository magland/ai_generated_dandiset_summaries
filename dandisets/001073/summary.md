### Abstract

The present study introduces three synthetic datasets derived from multi-channel intramuscular recordings of motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) from 10 distinct motor units in rats, exhibiting high signal-to-noise ratios (200-250). These datasets aim to investigate the impact of waveform shape noise variability on the accuracy of motor unit recordings. Each dataset encompasses 8 channels and spans a duration of 10 minutes. To simulate different levels of inherent shape variability observed in real recordings, the datasets feature three distinct noise levels: 0, 2, and 4 standard deviations (STD), calculated from the Kilosort spatial template matrix. This controlled variability permits a thorough examination of the influence of waveform distortions on motor unit analysis.

The experiments were conducted to simulate an electrophysiological environment where rats engaged in treadmill locomotion, providing a realistic context to assess motor unit behavior under varying noise conditions. The objective is to determine how waveform shape noise affects the identification and analysis of motor units, potentially informing the development of more robust data processing algorithms for electrophysiological recordings.

### NWB Data Description

The NWB files provide comprehensive datasets capturing key aspects of the simulated experiments. Each file includes acquisition traces for the ElectricalSeries, which document the continuous voltage signals recorded from the electrodes. Metadata about the electrodes, including their locations and group affiliations, is comprehensively detailed. Additionally, descriptions of the devices used, such as the Myomatrix RF400 and Open Ephys Acquisition System, are provided along with the general experimental setup, e.g., electrode configuration and recording techniques. The files also feature subject metadata, ensuring traceability and reproducibility of the experimental conditions.
