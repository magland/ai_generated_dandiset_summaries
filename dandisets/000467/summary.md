# Sparse and Stereotyped Encoding Implicates a Core Glomerulus for Ant Alarm Behavior

In this study, we investigated the neural underpinnings of odor-evoked responses in the antennal lobe of the clonal raider ant (*Ooceraea biroi*). Utilizing a transgenic ant line expressing the calcium indicator protein GCaMP6s in olfactory sensory neurons, we conducted high-resolution two-photon calcium imaging to capture the activity of neurons in response to various odor stimuli. The right antennal lobe was meticulously imaged at a volumetric rate of 0.83 volumes per second using a piezo device and resonant scanning galvanometer. The experimental protocols included both general odorant stimuli (isopropanol, ethylpyrazine, ethanol, 3-hexanone, propionic acid) and specific ant alarm pheromones (4-methyl-3-heptanone, 4-methyl-3-heptanol, 4-methyl-3-hexanol, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one) to discern the neural encoding specificity for social communication signals.

Our aim was to elucidate how discrete odorants and pheromones are represented in the antennal lobe, with a particular focus on identifying a core glomerulus implicated in alarm behavior. The experiments spanned both unilateral and bilateral antennal lobe imaging sessions to assess the lateralization of olfactory processing. Odor stimulation was precisely controlled, initiating 3 seconds into the recordings and maintained for a duration of 5 seconds, across multiple z-planes at 5-micron intervals. These data provide a comprehensive map of neural activity patterns induced by diverse chemosensory inputs, revealing insights into the sparse and stereotyped encoding mechanisms in the olfactory system of ants.

## Available Data in NWB Files

The Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files contain high-resolution recordings of calcium activity from the antennal lobe, captured through two-photon microscopy. Each recording includes 40 cycles, with details on various imaging planes and depths. Key data components available across these files include the time series of calcium fluorescence (TwoPhotonSeries), imaging plane configurations, optical channel specifications, and the experimental devices used. For each session, metadata such as session start time, session ID, and specific experimental conditions are also provided. This dataset encompasses multiple z-depth recordings (0 µm, 10 µm, 100 µm, 105 µm, and 110 µm), each representing discrete layers of the antennal lobe.
