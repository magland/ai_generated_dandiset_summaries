## Abstract

In this study, we explore the flexible nature of hippocampal place cells and their ability to encode sequences relative to reward positions during virtual navigation tasks in mice. Using two-photon imaging, we monitored hippocampal CA1 activity as mice navigated virtual environments with shifting hidden reward locations. The central hypothesis was to determine whether hippocampal circuitry encodes entire sequences of spatial and non-spatial events in relation to rewards. Notably, when the reward location changed, a subset of neurons adjusted their firing fields to maintain a consistent relative position to the reward. This adjustment formed sequences that spanned the breadth of spatial tasks at a behavioral timescale. As learning progressed, this reward-relative neural representation became more pronounced with additional neuronal recruitment, often anticipating changes in behavior following reward relocation. These observations illuminate the multifaceted and adaptable coding mechanisms of the hippocampus, emphasizing its capacity to amplify information pertinent to behavior while upholding a stable spatial processing framework.

## NWB File Data Description

The Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files comprise a rich dataset including two-photon imaging data and behavioral assays in mice, designed to examine hippocampal neuronal dynamics during spatial navigation tasks with variable reward outcomes. Type 1 NWB files primarily feature data derived from hippocampal CA1 region imaging, with detailed records of TwoPhotonSeries, ImagingPlanes, and devices utilized, including the two-photon microscope. These files include processed behavioral data with detailed time series on reward delivery, virtual environment interaction, locomotion parameters, and trial sequences. Optical physiology data encompass additional processed information including Backgrounds, Fluorescence, Image Segmentation output from suite2p, and signal deconvolution within specified regions of interest (ROIs).

Type 2 NWB files expand upon Type 1 data by adding another plane of cellular imaging, increasing the dimensional resolution of the captured neuronal activity. Here, each session reflects rich optophysiology details, with comprehensive recordings of fluorescence across multiple imaging planes and corresponding voxel segmentation data. This architecture enables a refined analysis of hippocampal activity and its modulation in response to environmental and reward-related changes.
