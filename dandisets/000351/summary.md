## Experiment Summary

The study by Jeong et al. (2022) investigates the role of mesolimbic dopamine release in conveying causal associations. Utilizing fiber photometry, the authors measured dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) in response to various behavioral paradigms. The experimental subjects were house mice (*Mus musculus*), and the aim was to delineate how dopamine signaling in the mesolimbic pathway influences associative learning processes. This research could have profound implications for our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying decision-making and reward processing.

The behavioral paradigms included both random reward deliveries and structured sessions with extended inter-trial intervals. Data collected were systematically organized, with sessions identified by specific IDs, allowing for a thorough analysis of behavioral and neurochemical data. The carefully controlled experimental conditions help elucidate the dynamic relationship between dopamine release patterns and behavior, contributing valuable insights into the neurobiological basis of learning and motivation.

## Available Data in NWB Files

### Type 1 NWB Files
- **Event Index Table**: Contains annotated events, including descriptions and indices for each event type.
- **Event Log**: Detailed logs of events during the session.
- **Session Metadata**: Information includes the file creation date, institution, lab, session ID, and subject identifier.
- **Subject Information**: Includes identifiers and session-specific descriptions.

### Type 2 NWB Files
- **Event Index Table**: Similar to Type 1 with detailed annotations of events.
- **Event Log**: Records of events during the session.
- **Photometry Data**: A series of fiber photometry measurements, with no additional description but including detailed fluorescence data and behavioral alignment.
