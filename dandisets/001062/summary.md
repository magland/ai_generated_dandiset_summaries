# Marmoset Electrophysiology and Kinematics During Prey Capture (Monkey MG)

This study investigates the neural and motor mechanisms underlying naturalistic prey capture behavior in the common marmoset (*Callithrix jacchus*). Using a 96-channel Utah array implanted in the primary motor and somatosensory cortex, the study recorded the electrophysiological activity of a marmoset engaged in capturing live moths. In parallel, kinematic data of the marmoset's hand, elbow, wrist, and head were collected and processed using DeepLabCut and Anipose to quantify the movements involved in prey capture. The combination of neural activity recording and detailed motor kinematics aims to illuminate the neural correlates of complex, goal-directed motor behavior.

The primary goal of this experiment is to understand how specific neuron groups in the sensorimotor cortex coordinate complex motor tasks in natural environments. Electrophysiological data, paired with high-resolution tracking of limb and head movements, allows for an in-depth analysis of neural firing patterns in response to specific motor actions. The data helps bridge the gap between isolated neural activity and coordinated behavioral output, providing insights into sensorimotor integration during task performance.
