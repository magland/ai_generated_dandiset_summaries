# Abstract

The experiment documented in the Dandiset titled "Nucleus accumbens dopamine release reflects Bayesian inference during instrumental learning" explores the intersection of neuroscience, behavior, and computational theory by examining dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens of mice during a probabilistic switching task. The primary objective is to understand how dopamine release corresponds to Bayesian inference processes during instrumental learning. This research leverages advanced neurophotonics fiber photometry to monitor dopamine release while mice engage in a two-alternative forced-choice task, where actions are taken based on learned probabilities of reward, necessitating continuous updating and inference making similar to Bayesian strategies.

Through detailed recording and analysis, this study aims to shed light on the dopaminergic mechanisms underlying adaptive learning behavior in dynamic environments. The results are expected to offer insights into how neurochemical signals contribute to decision-making processes that incorporate uncertainty and reward likelihood, thereby advancing neuroscientific understanding of learning mechanisms at a molecular level. This dataset thus offers a rich resource for further investigating the computational rules employed by the brain during decision-making and learning, particularly within the basal ganglia circuits.

# NWB File Data Description

The NWB files associated with this Dandiset encompass data from the fiber photometry recordings observing dopamine dynamics in the nucleus accumbens. Specifically, Type 1 files include repositories of both 415 nm and 470 nm fiber photometry response series, crucial for interpreting calcium indicator signals at these wavelengths in congruence with dopaminergic activity. In addition to these acquisition datasets, detailed device specifications, such as band optical filters, dichroic mirrors, excitation sources, and photodetectors, are meticulously documented within these files to support reproducibility and interpretative accuracy.

Type 2 files also contain information related to the experimental trials, recording various behavioral metrics including time-intervals for actions (left or right), outcome times, and reward status for each session. These files hold extended datasets documenting over a thousand trials per session, offering robust statistical data for analyzing learning behavior and inferential strategy changes over the course of the experiment. Such comprehensive experimental records are pivotal for future analysis and validation studies aimed at elucidating the detailed neural computations that underlie learning and decision-making processes in adaptive behavioral contexts.
