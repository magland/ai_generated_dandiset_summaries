### Experiment Summary

This study investigates the thermoregulatory mechanisms in the reticulospinal system of larval zebrafish. The experiments involve imaging the hindbrain and midbrain regions of nac -/-; Elavl3-H2B:GCaMP6s +/- larval zebrafish using two-photon microscopy. The reticulospinal neurons were labeled via backfills with Texas-Red Dextran, allowing for precise visualizations during the application of random wave temperature stimuli. By analyzing these interactions, researchers aim to contribute to the understanding of how temperature changes are processed and managed in the neural circuitry.

The experiment design utilizes a range of behavioral, surgical, and analytical techniques to comprehensively assess the neuronal and behavioral responses. Temperature stimuli with varying waveforms and frequencies were applied to elicit neural activities, which were then captured through calcium imaging. This setup strives to reveal the intricate dynamics of thermoregulation in zebrafish, potentially providing insights that could be applicable to broader vertebrate models.

### Data Description

The available data in the NWB files includes two-photon timeseries data for multiple imaging planes and channels, capturing fine-grained details of neuronal activity. The imaging planes span from 0 to 29, and each plane includes metadata on the device used, optical channels, and imaging parameters. Detailed behavioral data, specifically related to zebrafish tail movement, is included with raw and cumulative tail angle time series for each imaging plane. The data processing module encompasses CaImAn-derived calcium signals and their corresponding segmentation data, including ROI response series and Df/F calculations. Temperature stimulus data per imaging plane during the experiments is also available, aiding in correlating temperature changes with neural behavior.
