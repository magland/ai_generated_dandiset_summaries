# Transformation of a Spatial Map across the Hippocampal-Lateral Septal Circuit

## Abstract

The hippocampus constructs a cognitive map of the environment that is critical for spatial navigation and memory. However, the mechanisms by which this spatial representation is used by other brain regions to influence behavior are not well understood. This study explores the transmission and transformation of hippocampal firing patterns in the lateral septum (LS), one of the principal subcortical targets of the hippocampus. The research demonstrates that LS neurons carry reliable spatial information encoded in the phase of action potentials relative to hippocampal theta oscillations. Notably, the firing rates of LS neurons did not carry spatial information, indicating that a rate-independent spatial code exists in the LS.

Further analysis revealed that this spatial phase code exhibited an anatomical microstructure within the LS and was synchronized with hippocampal spatial codes by gamma frequency cell assemblies. A data-driven model suggested that the rate-independent spatial tuning observed in LS arose through the dynamic weighting of CA1 and CA3 hippocampal cell assemblies. These findings highlight the role of higher-order theta-dependent neuronal sequences in the transformation of hippocampal spatial maps and offer insights into the complex neural mechanisms underlying spatial cognition.

## Data Description

The available data consists of electrophysiological recordings and behavioral tracking data from five subjects (Rattus norvegicus). The dataset includes raw acquisition traces from multi-electrode extracellular recordings using various types of Neuronexus and Cambridge Neurotech silicon probes. The recordings were digitized at a 20 kHz rate. The data captures both local field potentials (LFP) and spike times for individual units, along with metadata about each electrode's physical and anatomical attributes.

In addition to electrophysiological data, the dataset contains behavioral data that includes positional tracking and orientation coordinates, error estimates from marker tracking, and detailed trial and epoch information. The recordings encompass various experimental trials and sleep states of the subjects. The data is organized in the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) format and provides comprehensive insights into the spatial encoding and transformation processes in the hippocampal-lateral septal circuit.
