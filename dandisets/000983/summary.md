### Abstract 

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data was collected from multichannel microelectrode arrays coated with various conductive materials, including poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), sputtered iridium oxide (SIROF), ruthenium oxide (RuOx), and titanium nitride (TiN). This study aimed to evaluate the impedance characteristics of these coating materials to enhance the performance of microelectrode arrays in various biomedical applications. Each material was subjected to in vitro experiments, examining its impedance response to understand better the electrical properties and potential suitability for neural interfaces.

The experiments involved the use of potentiostatic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, performed with multichannel microelectrode arrays under controlled laboratory conditions. The electrode arrays, each coated with a specific material, were tested to gather frequency-dependent impedance data. This data provides critical insights into the electrochemical behavior of each material, potentially guiding the development of more efficient and effective bioelectronic devices.

### Data Description 

The available data in the NWB files comprises frequency-dependent impedance measurements, including Z-real and Z-imaginary components, from the EIS experiments performed on the different electrode materials. Each file contains a comprehensive set of metadata describing the experimental conditions, the specific coating material used, and the session details. The datasets within these files include the physical properties of the electrodes, such as area, location, and material, along with the measured frequency and impedance values. Devices used, such as the GAMRY potentiostat, are also detailed within the files to ensure reproducibility and context.
