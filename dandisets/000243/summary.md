## Experiment Summary

This study presents a detailed MRI investigation of an ex vivo human brainstem. The primary aim of this experiment was to accurately capture and analyze high-resolution structural images of the brainstem, which is a critical area of the human central nervous system due to its involvement in numerous essential functions including motor control, sensory analysis, and regulation of cardiac and respiratory activity. The acquisition of such images helps in enhancing our understanding of the anatomical intricacies and potential pathologies associated with this region.

The dataset provides an invaluable resource for neuroscientists and medical researchers aiming to conduct a comprehensive study of the human brainstemâ€™s anatomy and functionality in both healthy and diseased states. The meticulously acquired ex vivo MRI data can provide a benchmark for comparison with in vivo images, supporting advancements in medical imaging techniques and the development of targeted therapeutic interventions.

## Data Available in the NWB Files

The dataset comprises MRI images that follow the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) standard, ensuring compatibility and ease of use for subsequent analyses. Although there are no Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files included in this dataset, the MRI images available are of high resolution and are crucial for structural mapping. The images encompass various orientations and sequences, facilitating a comprehensive anatomical description.
