### Abstract

This dataset captures the experimental results from a study investigating the use of brain-machine interfaces (BMI) via group-weight methods with two rhesus monkeys, aimed at assessing and improving the efficacy of neural control over time. Conducted by Chenguang Zhang at Beijing Normal University in Beijing, China, the experiment focused on evaluating the performance improvements of two rhesus monkeys engaged in tasks where they controlled a cursor by brain activity. The dataset offers detailed trial-by-trial analyses, including cursor position and velocity, trial correctness, and various other performance metrics, allowing a comprehensive understanding of the monkeys' adaptation and learning.

The primary purpose of the experiment appears to be the evaluation of neural adaptation and learning in the context of BMI applications. This includes tracking the monkeys' control over cursor movements in a 2D plane and assessing the improvement over multiple sessions. The detailed data on cursor dynamics and neural activity provide valuable insights into the performance enhancements achieved through repeated trials of BMI control.

### Available Data

The dataset comprises two Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files, each documenting trials from one monkey, identified as `monkeyT` and `monkeyK`. The NWB files include a wealth of data across numerous trialsâ€”2119 for `monkeyT` and 3772 for `monkeyK`. For each trial, data recorded include whether the trial was correct or timed out, cursor position and velocity, cursor and target sizes, trial durations, starting and stopping times, and various indices related to neural activity. Additionally, detailed recordings of both freeze times and movement periods of the cursor and corresponding neural spikes across multiple channels are provided. These data support an in-depth analysis of trial dynamics and neural activity patterns throughout the experiments.
