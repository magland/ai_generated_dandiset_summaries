## Abstract

This Dandiset comprises a comprehensive study on the behavior of zebrafish (_Danio rerio_) in a controlled environment with a constant temperature of 22°C. The experiment was conducted using a specialized gradient behavior chamber, designed to analyze how zebrafish navigate and position themselves when subjected to a uniform thermal gradient. Specifically, the experiment aimed to understand spatial behavior and compass orientation of zebrafish, which were placed in separate lanes of the chamber. The study provides insights into the innate preference and adaptive behaviors of zebrafish when thermal stimuli are constant and uniform, which may inform broader research on thermoregulation and behavioral ecology in aquatic organisms.

Conducted by researchers at The Ohio State University, the experiment was meticulously documented, capturing various data streams related to fish behavior. The primary focus was on quantifying position, heading direction, and proximity to temperature gradients within the chamber. The findings are expected to advance knowledge on zebrafish behavioral patterns under specific environmental conditions, providing a foundation for further exploration into genetic and neural correlates of temperature preference. This research aligns with the broader aim of comprehending the behavioral adaptation mechanisms of ectothermic animals.

## NWB File Data Description

The NWB files included in this Dandiset encompass detailed recordings from experiments analyzing zebrafish behavior at a controlled temperature of 22°C. Each file contains multiple data types, including BehavioralTimeSeries, ProcessingModules, SpatialSeries, and CompassDirection, documenting fish behavior within left and right lanes of the temperature chamber. Key data captured involve absolute fish heading in radians and precise positional data in millimeter coordinates. Additionally, time-series data annotate the specific temperatures at fish positions, facilitating comprehensive assessments of environmental interactions. These detailed datasets provide an expansive view of how zebrafish react to constant temperature conditions, with 100 Hz frame rate and high spatial resolution enhancing the fidelity of the captured data.
