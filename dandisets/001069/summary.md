## Abstract

This study investigates the electrophysiological dynamics of temporal lobe seizures in non-human primates (NHPs). Seizures were chemically induced in the hippocampus of two rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) via penicillin injection. The primary aim was to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying temporal lobe epilepsy, focusing on signal propagation and network disruptions during seizure events. The use of multi-electrode extracellular recordings allows for a detailed spatiotemporal analysis of neural activity both during the onset and progress of seizures.

The collected data provides valuable insights into the electrophysiological signatures of temporal lobe seizures. Understanding these signatures is critical for developing therapeutic strategies and improving diagnostic techniques for epilepsy. The results derived from this study may also lay the groundwork for broader applications in other types of seizure and neurological disorder research.

## Description of Available Data

The dataset comprises 10 NWB files, each containing comprehensive electrophysiological recordings from two rhesus monkeys during induced temporal lobe seizures. The primary components include ElectricalSeries acquisition traces, detailed metadata on extracellular electrodes, and specifics on ElectrodeGroups and devices used. Each NWB file captures data from 35 channels, with metadata covering channel names, electrode locations, and related group identifiers. The dataset also includes time-stamped sessions with unique identifiers, providing full traceability and context for each recording session.
