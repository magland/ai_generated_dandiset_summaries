# Data for: Distinct spatiotemporal patterns of syntactic and semantic processing in human inferior frontal gyrus

## Summary

This dataset comprises high-gamma brain activity recordings (70-150 Hz) from human subjects, acquired using electrocorticography (ECoG). The primary focus is on neural responses during tasks involving syntactic and semantic processing in the inferior frontal gyrus. These recordings are formatted according to the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) standard, enhancing ease of use and integration within the neuroscience research community. The dataset supports findings published in the article "Distinct spatiotemporal patterns of syntactic and semantic processing in human inferior frontal gyrus" (DOI: 10.1038/s41562-022-01334-6).

The dataset aims to shed light on the distinct spatiotemporal patterns of neural activation associated with syntactic and semantic information processing. By analyzing ECoG data from 10 human subjects, researchers aim to delineate how different linguistic functions are represented within the inferior frontal gyrus. This could provide significant insights into the neural mechanisms underlying language processing in the human brain.

## Available Data

The NWB files contain comprehensive electrophysiological data acquired through ECoG. Specifically, the contents include high-gamma data, metadata about the extracellular electrodes, and information about the devices used, manufactured by PMT. There are 256 recorded electrodes, and the dataset includes details such as electrode grouping, location within the brain, and hardware filtering descriptions. Each session records information under identifiers such as session start time, timestamps reference time, and subject identifiers. The data also include references to related publications and metadata about the experimenter and institution.
