### Characterization of Neuron Action Potential Triggering Using Sine Wave Electrostimulation at Varying Frequencies

Neurons from E18 Sprague Dawley rat hippocampal cultures were subjected to electrostimulation using sine and modulated sine waves at various frequencies with the primary aim to characterize action potential (AP) triggering mechanisms. Voltage-sensitive dye FluoVolt was employed to report transmembrane potential changes with high temporal resolution, facilitating optical measurement of induced APs. This methodology allowed for time-lapse imaging of neuronal responses to precisely controlled electrical stimuli, adding valuable insights into the electrical properties and behavior of hippocampal neurons under different stimulation conditions.

Electrophysiological experiments were carried out using an IX71 Olympus microscope paired with an iXon Ultra 897 CCD camera for high-speed image acquisition at 3,086.4 frames per second. Neurons were visualized with a PlanApo N 60x, 1.42 NA objective, and data were recorded using the Andor SOLIS interface. Each time-lapse sequence typically consisted of 1200 frames, corresponding to a total recording duration of 388.47 milliseconds. The experimental environment comprised a standard physiological solution, ensuring optimal neuronal function and accurate representation of AP dynamics under sine wave stimulation, calibrated to specific voltage-to-electric field ratios.

### Available Data in NWB Files

The NWB files contain detailed acquisition data from time-lapse imaging experiments. The datasets include 16x16 pixel image stacks that capture the dynamic changes in transmembrane membrane potential within neuron populations at high temporal resolution. Each NWB file documents the specific conditions of the experiment, such as the frequency and amplitude of sine wave stimulation, the exact configuration of the microscope setup, and the photometric properties of the fluorescence dye (FluoVolt) used. Essential metadata, such as the session ID, session start time, and protocol specifics, are also available, providing comprehensive context for each recorded dataset.
