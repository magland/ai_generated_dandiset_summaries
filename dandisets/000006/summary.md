## Experiment Summary

This study investigates neural activity in the anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) of mice performing a delay response task. Extracellular electrophysiology recordings were used to track neural activity from two populations of neurons, referred to as pyramidal track upper and lower. These recordings aim to characterize the relationship between neural activity and movement execution, providing insights into motor planning and preparatory activity.

The research was conducted by Mike Economo and Karel Svoboda at the Janelia Research Campus and involves a detailed examination of neuronal responses during different phases of a delay response task. Data were collected from 12 mice using a combination of behavioral and electrophysiological techniques to understand the neural dynamics underlying motor control.

## Data Available in NWB Files

The NWB files contain a wealth of data, including:

- **Behavioral Events**: Acquisition of lick times, both for left and right licks, capturing the behavioral responses of mice during the task.
- **Electrophysiological Data**: Metadata about the extracellular electrodes, including filtering, grouping, impedance, and spatial coordinates (x, y, z). The data detail the exact location and characteristics of the electrodes used in the recordings.
- **Experimental Trials**: Time intervals documenting the start and stop times of each trial, cue start times, pole in/out times, response types, and whether a stim or no-stim condition was present. Good and bad trial markers indicate the quality of each trial for further analysis.
- **Cell and Unit Recordings**: Information on units/cells, including cell type, depth, electrode references, quality of spike sorting, and timestamps of spike events.
