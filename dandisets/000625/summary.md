### Abstract
This study examines the dynamics of molecularly identified interneurons within the CA1 region of the hippocampus in mice. Using two-photon calcium imaging, the activity of 231 regions of interest (ROIs) was recorded across three separate imaging sessions. Mice were head-fixed and allowed to run on a voluntary treadmill, providing a controlled yet dynamic environment to observe neuronal activity correlated with behavior. The goal was to identify and label the most numerous subtypes of interneurons and understand their functional roles within the hippocampal circuitry.

During the sessions, fluorescence traces, DfOverF traces (a relative measure of calcium concentration changes), and the precise timing of water rewards were recorded. Additionally, the spatial positioning of the mice on the treadmill was logged. This comprehensive dataset allows for an intricate examination of interneuron subtype behavior under controlled experimental conditions, offering insights into their roles in hippocampal function.

### NWB Files Data Description
The NWB files include detailed datasets that encompass raw imaging data and processed data related to hippocampal interneurons. Key contents are:
- **Raw imaging data:** Individual cropped images of each ROI.
- **Processed data:** DfOverF traces and fluorescence traces for all 231 ROIs.
- **Interneuron Subtype Identification:** DynamicTable specifying the subtype of each ROI cell, covering categories such as PVBC, SOM, BISTR, and others.
- **Behavioral Data:** IntervalSeries capturing the timing of water rewards.
- **Positional Data:** 1D position of the mouse on the treadmill belt recorded as SpatialSeries.
- **Experimental setup:** Information on the imaging plane, optical channels, and devices used.
- **Imaging segmentation:** Pixel masks and indices for each ROI.
