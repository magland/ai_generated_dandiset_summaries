**Abstract**

The dataset explores the modulation of cerebral blood flow by astrocytic cAMP elevation, independent of IP3R2-mediated Ca2+ signaling, using a mouse model. The experiment aims to dissect the mechanisms underlying neurovascular coupling by evaluating the roles of astrocytic GPCR signaling pathways in regulating cerebral blood flow. The study utilizes optogenetic techniques to specifically elevate cAMP levels in astrocytes while monitoring the resultant effects on blood flow using one-photon microscopy. This investigation provides insight into how non-canonical cAMP signaling influences hemodynamic responses, which could have significant implications for understanding neurological diseases associated with cerebral blood flow dysregulation.

Through the use of advanced imaging techniques, the experiment was performed at the University of Copenhagen with contributions from researchers at Gunma University. By employing a one-photon imaging approach in genetically modified mouse models, the researchers were able to visualize and quantify changes in blood flow dynamics in response to targeted cAMP signaling alterations. This level of analysis helps to pinpoint the cellular and molecular players involved in the regulation of cerebral blood flow, paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies targeting astrocytic pathways in neurovascular disorders.

**NWB Data Description**

The Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files document various aspects of the experimental setups and results. Each NWB file contains data from one-photon imaging sessions conducted with devices like a one-photon macroscope, capturing details such as imaging planes, optical channels, and specific session identifiers. The dataset comprises detailed information including timestamps, session start times, and optical configurations. These data points are fundamental to replicate experimental conditions, facilitating further analysis and interpretation of the results. The NWB files summarize data acquired during the specific imaging sessions, with references to individual figures and experiment sessions.
