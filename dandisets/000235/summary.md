# Thermoregulatory Responses in the Forebrain of Larval Zebrafish

## Experiment Summary

In this study, the objective was to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying thermoregulatory responses in the forebrain of larval zebrafish. The zebrafish were genetically modified with nac -/-; Elavl3-H2B:GCaMP6s +/-; vglut2a-mCherry +/- to enable specific imaging of forebrain activity through the expression of fluorescent proteins. During the experiments, temperature stimuli were administered in a randomized wave pattern to assess the responses of the forebrain neural circuits.

The use of two-photon microscopy allowed for high-resolution imaging of neuronal activity across multiple planes within the forebrain while simultaneously capturing behavioral data through tail movement analysis. The combination of genetic tools and advanced imaging techniques provided insights into how changes in temperature affect neural activity and behavior in zebrafish, potentially elucidating the pathways involved in temperature homeostasis.

## NWB Files Description

The NWB files contain extensive data on neural imaging and behavioral responses during the experiments. Specifically, the datasets include time series recordings from 30 different planes in the forebrain, collected through two-photon microscopy at The Ohio State University. The data comprise TwoPhotonSeries, ImagingPlane, and OpticalChannel groups, detailing the spatial and temporal dynamics of neural calcium activity. In addition, behavioral data such as cumulative tail angle and raw tail segment angles are recorded to link neuronal activity with observed behaviors.

Calcium imaging data have undergone CaImAn-based segmentation and processing to identify and measure region-of-interest (ROI) responses, delivering inferred calcium signals and Î”F/F values across all imaged planes. The processed data also include segmentation masks for each plane, offering detailed spatial maps of neural activity. Behavioral time series provide metrics on tail movements, which are crucial for understanding the behavioral context of neural responses to temperature stimuli.
