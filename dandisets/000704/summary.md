### Abstract

The experiment detailed within Dandiset 000704 investigates the behavioral thermoregulation of the zebrafish (*Danio rerio*) at a constant temperature of 30°C. The study aims to assess the swimming behavior of zebrafish in controlled thermal environments to better understand their preference and avoidance behavior in response to constant temperatures. Conducted in a gradient behavior chamber at The Ohio State University, the experiment measures zebrafish movement and orientation in conditions where both the front and back temperatures of the chamber are stabilized at 30°C. The data collected provide insights into the decision-making processes of zebrafish in uniform thermal environments, contributing to the broader understanding of thermoregulatory behavior in ectotherms.

Data collection was executed on August 8, 2023, with zebrafish aged five days post fertilization. Using high-resolution tracking at a frame rate of 100 Hz, the position, heading, and chamber position of each fish were recorded. This experimental setup facilitates thorough analysis of spatial behavior and thermal preference. The results could inform studies on the neural mechanisms underlying temperature preference and avoidance, and how such preferences might evolve or vary among different zebrafish populations.

### NWB Files Description

The NWB files contain comprehensive datasets recording fish behavior in the gradient behavior chamber, including data on fish heading and chamber position captured within two separate swim lanes. The datasets include absolute heading in radians and the positional coordinates within the chamber, specified in millimeters. The temperature data at each fish's position is also included in time series format, aligning with the experiment's constant environmental temperature settings. Additional scratch data provide metadata about the experiment, including fish type, fish position data, and thermal conditions.
