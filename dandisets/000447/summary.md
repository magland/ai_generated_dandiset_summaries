## Experiment Summary

The dataset describes an investigation into the neural activity in the dorsal CA1 region of the hippocampus and the prelimbic region of the prefrontal cortex of rats during exposure to novel and familiar WTrack environments. The aim of the experiment appears to be understanding the neural correlates of spatial and working memory as rats navigate through the different stages of the WTrack environment. The recordings include neural spikes from single units, local field potential (LFP) recordings, and behavioral data such as position, velocity, and trajectory information across three behavioral epochs: initial exposure to the novel WTrack, exposure to a familiar WTrack, and subsequent return to the novel WTrack.

The setup utilizes a 31, 32, or 64 tetrode microdrive array to capture detailed electrophysiological data as the subjects perform spatial navigation tasks. The behavioral trials are recorded with attention to whether the navigations were correct or incorrect, their start and end positions, and the inward or outward trajectory types. By examining the neural activity in response to the familiarity of the environment, the experiment aims to advance our understanding of the interplay between hippocampal and prefrontal cortical networks in memory and learning processes.
