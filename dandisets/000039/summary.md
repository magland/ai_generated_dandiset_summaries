### Abstract

This dataset from the Allen Institute represents a comprehensive investigation into contrast tuning in the mouse visual cortex using two-photon calcium imaging. The primary aim was to measure the neural responses to full-field drifting gratings in varying directions and contrasts. GCaMP6f-expressing Cre lines were utilized to image pyramidal neurons across cortical layers (Cux2: layer 2/3; Rorb: layer 4; Rbp4: layer 5; Ntsr1: layer 6) and inhibitory interneurons (Vip and Sst). The study designed its experimental sessions to align with the Allen Brain Observatory's data collection pipeline, ensuring consistent visual stimulus conditions, imaging systems, and data processing methodologies.

The observations and recordings included responses to eight different directions and six different contrast levels (ranging from 5% to 80%), capturing the activity of neurons in terms of calcium influx as an indicator of neural firing. Specifically, the research focused on how variations in visual stimuli contrast and orientation affect the activity of different neuron types across the cortical layers, thereby adding valuable insights into the functional architecture of the mouse visual cortex.

### Data Description

The NWB files comprising this dataset include detailed records of the experimental sessions. Key data elements in these files are time series data of neural activity, segmented cell data including dynamic table regions for cell ROIs, and intervals marking the start and stop times of epochs. The primary datasets within each NWB file include raw and demixed fluorescence traces, neuropil and motion-corrected traces, eye and running behavior, and metadata on visual stimuli parameters such as contrast, direction, spatial frequency, and temporal frequency. The dataset encompasses extensive image segmentation data with image masks for each ROI, motion correction details, and behavior data correlating to the visual stimuli and response epochs.
