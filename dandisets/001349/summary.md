## Abstract

The experiment detailed in the Dandiset 001349 investigates the development and refinement of neuronal circuits in the primary somatosensory cortex of mice, with a focus on how GABAergic inputs shape neuronal subnetworks. Two-photon calcium imaging was carried out on developing mice from postnatal days 11 to 21 (P11 to P21) to gather detailed insights into neural activity and behavior. This imaging is complemented with synchronized behavioral video recordings, providing a comprehensive view of the activity within the cortex under various conditions. The study seeks to elucidate the role of inhibitory signaling in the formation and maturation of cortical networks during this critical developmental window, ultimately contributing to our understanding of sensory processing maturation in the brain.

The use of advanced imaging techniques, such as two-photon calcium imaging, allows for high-resolution observation of neural dynamics in vivo, facilitating the analysis of both spatial and temporal patterns in neural network activity. Custom data processing and analysis were utilized, leveraging open-source Python and MATLAB toolboxes to parse and interpret the vast data sets generated. This work benefits from the synchronized data streams, allowing for the study of the neural basis of behavior and the changes in the neuronal microenvironment influenced by GABAergic signaling, offering new insights into the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying the establishment of functional neural circuits.

## Data Available in NWB Files

The Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files in this dataset contain rich data from two-photon calcium imaging of the somatosensory cortex of developing mice. The files detail the calcium events, delta F/F responses, and corrected fluorescence activities across numerous regions of interest (ROIs), with data for 197 unique ROIs. Additionally, the files include z-scores and neuropil fluorescence measures. Image segmentation data, such as pixel masks for ROI identification, are also provided. The datasets were collected using a Nikon A1 plus two-photon microscope, facilitating high-throughput and precise imaging necessary for this developmental study. Each file provides timestamped records of the events, along with detailed experimental settings, including session descriptions and institutional affiliations.
