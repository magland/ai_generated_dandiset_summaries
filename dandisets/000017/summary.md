## Abstract

Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying choice, action, and engagement is crucial for elucidating brain function. This study employs large-scale Neuropixels recordings to examine the distributed coding of these cognitive processes across different regions of the mouse brain. In a controlled experimental setup, mice perform a head-fixed visual discrimination task, allowing for the collection of detailed electrophysiological and behavioral data. The primary aim is to analyze how different brain regions coordinate during task engagement and decision-making, offering insights into the distributed nature of neural coding.

The research focuses on correlating specific neural activities with behaviorally significant events such as licking, wheel movements, and visual stimuli. Across multiple sessions, data were collected from various subjects, providing a robust dataset for investigating the dynamics of neural ensembles. This approach allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the temporal and spatial characteristics of neural signals and their relationship with the cognitive states of choice and engagement during the task.

## Data Description for NWB Files

The NWB files comprise extensive electrophysiological and behavioral data acquired during the experiments. Key elements include:

- **Lick Detection:** Voltage recordings from a thin-film piezo connected to the lick spout, capturing deflections indicative of licks.
- **Wheel Position:** Position measurements from a rotary encoder attached to a wheel, documenting forelimb-driven movements by the mice.
- **Electrode Group Metadata:** Detailed information about Neuropixels probes, including axial and horizontal angles, coordinates in the Allen Institute's Common Coordinate Framework, and channel-specific properties like impedance.
- **Spike Sorting Data:** Cluster depths, spike amplitudes, spike times, and annotations of neuron quality, offering insights into neuronal firing patterns.
- **Behavioral Epochs and Events:** Time-stamped intervals detailing task engagement periods, feedback types, and pupil-tracking data, providing a comprehensive temporal context.

Additionally, the files contain data on visual and auditory stimulus presentations, behavioral epochs such as spontaneous and task-related intervals, and detailed metadata for each electrode and unit involved in the recordings.
