**Structure and variability of delay activity in premotor cortex**

The experiment investigates the structure and variability of neuronal delay activity in the premotor cortex by recording extracellular electrophysiological signals. The study involves implanting 96-channel Utah arrays in the motor cortex (M1) and the premotor cortex (PMd) of two rhesus monkeys. The monkeys perform four different cursor movement tasks, designed to understand the neural mechanisms underlying delayed motor responses. By analyzing hand, eye, and cursor positions as well as local field potentials (LFP) and sorted spikes, the researchers aim to elucidate the cortical dynamics during the delay period preceding a motor movement.

The trial data captures various aspects of motor performance, including the positions of the cursor, hand, and eye over time, the acquisition and holding times of targets, and whether the trials were successful. This rich dataset allows for a detailed examination of how neurons in the motor and premotor cortex coordinate during tasks that require holding and then moving to a target. The goal is to better understand the neural basis of motor planning and execution, specifically how delay periods are represented in neural activity.

**Available Data in NWB Files**

The NWB files comprise a comprehensive dataset that includes the following key data types:
- **Electrophysiological Data:** Records from 96-channel Utah arrays implanted in the M1 and PMd regions, including LFP signals and spike times for sorted units. Data also includes metadata about electrode properties such as location, impedance, and filtering.
- **Behavioral Data:** Time-series data of cursor, hand, and eye positions during task performance, as well as detailed trial information like start/stop times, target acquisition times, and barriers.
- **Stimulus Data:** Records of juice reward presentations to the monkeys.
- **Processing Modules:** Intermediate data related to spike sorting and LFP processing, allowing for deeper insights into the neural signals during task performance.

The dataset facilitates multi-dimensional analysis of neural activity, behavior, and task-related variables, providing a robust foundation for advancing our understanding of motor control and planning.
