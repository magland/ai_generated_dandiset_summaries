### Abstract

Visual sensory systems are known to adapt to the mean and variance of their inputs, but the adaptation to higher-order statistical properties such as sparsity remains less understood. In this study, we investigate how visual motion circuits in *Drosophila melanogaster* adapt to changes in stimulus sparsity. We show that early visual neurons in both the ON and OFF pathways of *Drosophila* exhibit altered responses to stimulus sparsity, enhancing their responsiveness to both sparse light and dark stimuli, while maintaining linear responses to dense stimuli. Further, downstream direction-selective neurons are similarly impacted, with sparse stimuli engaging both ON and OFF pathways, provoking opposite responses to light and dark regions of dense stimuli. This adaptation to sparsity seems to recruit a larger fraction of the visual circuitry, thereby enhancing the salience of isolated stimuli.

The findings suggest that adaptation to visual sparsity allows for an increased recruitment of neural pathways that can accentuate the detection of isolated stimuli. This study expands our understanding of sensory adaptation by revealing how neural circuits are fine-tuned to respond to the fine temporal structure of visual stimuli, beyond what is captured by traditional low-order statistics. The data underscore the complexity of sensory processing and have potential implications for artificial sensory systems design and understanding of visual cognition mechanisms.

### Data Description

The dataset consists of 100 NWB files, each capturing 2-photon imaging data of the visual response adaptation in *Drosophila melanogaster*. The files include information on TwoPhotonSeries that provides temporal imaging data, details about the OpticalChannel used for imaging, and specifications of the ImagingPlane. Each NWB file documents data from individual sessions, giving insight into the cellular and circuit-level adaptations to visual sparsity. These files enable researchers to analyze how sparsity affects the neural activity recorded through two-photon microscopy, which is complemented by metadata related to the experimental context, including the type of subjects and devices used.
