# Patch-seq recordings from mouse visual cortex

## Abstract

This dataset comprises whole-cell Patch-seq recordings from neurons in the mouse visual cortex, collected by the Allen Institute for Brain Science to characterize the electrophysiological properties of different neuron types. The majority of neurons in this dataset are GABAergic interneurons, while a smaller subset includes glutamatergic neurons from layer 2/3 of the visual cortex. The aim of this study is likely to advance the understanding of neuronal diversity and function within this specific brain region, by integrating high-fidelity electrophysiological recordings with subsequent transcriptomic analyses.

## Data Description

The dataset is stored in five Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files, each containing detailed information on the intracellular electrophysiological recordings. Data entities include VoltageClampSeries and CurrentClampSeries measurements, alongside metadata such as the recording devices used (Harvard Bioscience ITC18USB), and session-specific details like stimulus waveforms and processing modules for spike detection. Comprehensive lab notebooks and stimulus set configurations are also provided to enable reproducibility and detailed analysis of the recorded neuronal activities.
