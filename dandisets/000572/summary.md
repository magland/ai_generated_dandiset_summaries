### Abstract

The dataset presents an in-depth exploration of the neuronal activities within a cortico-cerebellar loop during motor planning tasks in mice. The core experiment involves a delayed response task where mice utilize short-term memory to plan and execute directional licking. By employing a combination of electrophysiological and optogenetic approaches, this study aims to map the cerebellar cortex's activity and its interactions with cortical structures during motor planning phases. The experiment's insights are pivotal for understanding the neuronal circuits underpinning motor behavior and their role in memory and decision-making processes.

The research, supported by a range of foundations and NIH grants, leverages advanced techniques such as spike sorting and optogenetic photoinhibition to manipulate and measure neuronal spikes and waveforms. This precise methodology allows for critical discoveries concerning how specific neuronal populations contribute to the planning and execution of motor tasks. Such data are fundamental to unraveling the cortico-cerebellar dynamics involved in motor cognition.

### Data Description

The NWB files comprise a comprehensive collection of electrophysiological data, including sorted spike times, spike waveforms, and spike band voltage traces. Specifically, various units corresponding to individual neurons are identified and annotated with metadata on their cell types, approximate depths, and electrodes involved in spike events. Trial data have been meticulously recorded, detailing periods such as response, sample, and delay epochs, alongside specific cues and errors. The NWB files also document the experimental setup, including optogenetic stimulation parameters and surgical details of the electrode implantation and optogenetic setup.

Additionally, spike events are categorized and indexed, encapsulating both spontaneous and stimulus-driven activities. The experiment extensively used photoinhibition trials, with distinct conditions for inhibiting different brain hemisphere areas, helping delineate their functional contributions to motor planning.
