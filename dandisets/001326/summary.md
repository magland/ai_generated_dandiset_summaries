# Brain-wide Mouse Electrophysiology During Aversive Stimuli and Ketamine

The experiment investigates the impact of aversive stimuli and ketamine on brain-wide neural activity in mice using extracellular electrophysiology. Specifically, Neuropixels probes were employed to perform high-density recordings of neuronal activity throughout the mouse brain. The study aims to explore how external stimuli and pharmacological interventions, like ketamine infusion, influence affective behavior and emotion-like states. The recordings, conducted under controlled settings of stimuli such as eyepuff assays, are intended to draw parallels with emotional response mechanisms in humans, thereby advancing our understanding of conserved brain-wide processes.

This research not only contributes to a better comprehension of the neural underpinnings of emotional responses but also provides a richer perspective on how ketamine, a known anesthetic and antidepressant, alters these processes at a neuronal level. The outcomes could shed light on new therapeutic avenues for mood disorders by elucidating the neural circuitry underpinning emotion regulation. The study is a collaborative effort led by researchers at Stanford University and funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

## Data Description

The Dandiset comprises 13 NWB files from recordings conducted with Mus musculus, commonly known as the house mouse. The data includes detailed information on electrode configurations, acquired using Neuropixels 1.0 probes, and characterizes neural activities via spike sorting techniques. Each NWB file catalogs extensive metadata about electrode positioning, sampling metrics, as well as raw and processed electrophysiological data. Key components include timestamps of ketamine infusion, stimulus presentations, and experimental intervals. Additionally, variables such as spike times, brain regions, electrode locations, and signal-to-noise ratios are precisely detailed, offering a robust dataset for analyzing neural dynamics during the administered assays.
