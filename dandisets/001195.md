# Dandiset 001195: Separable Dorsal Raphe Dopamine Projections Mediate Sociability and Valence

## General Overview
This Dandiset is contributed by prominent researchers including Laurel Keyes and Christopher R. Lee from the Salk Institute of Biological Sciences. It supports the publication titled "Separable Dorsal Raphe Dopamine Projections Mediate Sociability and Valence". The primary funding for this research comes from several prestigious foundations such as the JPB Foundation, the Alfred P Sloan Foundation, and the National Institute of Mental Health.

The dataset focuses on studies performed on Mus musculus (house mouse) and involves advanced techniques like cell population imaging and various surgical procedures. The data is standardized under the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) format and includes comprehensive metadata.

## Specific Data Content
The Dandiset contains 41 NWB files, which include a variety of data types and experimental setups:
