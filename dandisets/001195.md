# Separable Dorsal Raphe Dopamine Projections Mediate Sociability and Valence

## Overview
This dataset, titled **"Separable Dorsal Raphe Dopamine Projections Mediate Sociability and Valence"**, consists of experimental data supporting the associated publication. The study investigates the role of dorsal raphe dopamine projections in mediating social behavior and valence in mice (*Mus musculus*). The dataset contains data acquired using cell population imaging techniques, specifically one-photon imaging.

### Data Collection
The experiments were performed at the **Salk Institute of Biological Sciences**, under the supervision of **Kay Tye Lab**, and led by principal investigators **Christopher R. Lee**, **Gillian A. Matthews**, and others. Imaging was carried out using an **NVoke2 microscope** to capture optical physiology data. Experiments involved optogenetic stimulation of specific brain regions, with data collected across multiple sessions.

### Experimental Design
The behavioral paradigm used in the experiments involved a 15-minute session with the following phases:
- **5-minute habituation**
- **5-minute stimulation with a juvenile mouse (counterbalanced across two days)**
- **5-minute post-stimulation with the juvenile mouse**

Optogenetic stimulation was delivered at **20 Hz** with **589 nm light**, using a **10 mW/mmÂ²** laser to activate specific neural populations. Viral injections were performed to express genetically encoded calcium indicators (**GCAMP7f**) and optogenetic actuators (**Chrimson-tdTomato**) in the targeted brain regions, including the **medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)** and **basolateral amygdala (BLA)**.

### Available Data
The dataset contains **41 Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files**, amounting to approximately **38.9 GB** of data, collected from **12 subjects**. The available data include:

- **Behavioral videos**: Recordings of the animals' behavior during the experiment.
- **Histology images**: High-resolution images of brain tissue for anatomical verification.
- **Optical physiology data**: One-photon imaging data capturing calcium activity in neural populations.
- **Fluorescence data**: Processed fluorescence traces from the calcium imaging experiments, segmented into regions of interest (ROIs) using the CNMFe algorithm.
- **ROI segmentation**: Detailed ROI data, including pixel masks for each ROI, which define the spatial extent of active neuronal populations.
- **Stimulus and optogenetic protocols**: Information on the stimulation parameters, including frequency, duration, and light intensity used in the experiments.

### Key Data Features
- **Imaging Data**: Collected from a **one-photon microscope** (NVoke2), with optical channel information and metadata detailing the imaging plane and device settings.
- **Optical Physiology Processing**: The data were processed using CNMFe to extract calcium signals from the recorded fluorescence data. ROIs were identified, and their responses were recorded over time.
- **Histology**: High-resolution histological images of brain slices to verify the viral injection sites and the placement of optical implants.

This dataset provides a rich resource for researchers interested in analyzing neural circuits involved in social behavior, using optogenetics and calcium imaging to dissect neural activity patterns in vivo.
