### Experiment Summary

In this study, we investigated the calcium dynamics within the CA1 region of the hippocampus in neonatal mouse pups aged between 5 and 12 days postnatal. Using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging techniques, we employed the GCaMP6s calcium indicator in both wild-type (WT) mice and GadCre mice co-expressing GCaMP6s and flex-tdTomato to record neural activity in both pyramidal cells and interneurons. The imaging data were acquired at 8 Hz, with a field of view of 400x400 Âµm, allowing high-resolution observation of the neuronal population.

In parallel with the imaging, spontaneous motor behaviors of the mouse pups were recorded to correlate physical movements with neural activity. A total of 35 subjects were included in the dataset, contributing to 62 NWB files with significant data volume amounting to approximately 73 GB. The collected data offer valuable insights into the early development of neural circuits and the interplay between motor behavior and hippocampal activity.

### Description of Available Data in NWB Files

The NWB files contain comprehensive data from the imaging sessions, including raw and motion-corrected two-photon imaging movies, imaging plane and device information, and detailed time-stamped recording intervals. Specific recordings of behavioral data such as long movements, twitches, and unclassified movements are also included, along with data on piezoelectric sensor output. The files provide complete metadata about the experimental protocols, including details of anesthesia, pharmacology, and virus injection for those mice expressing GCaMP6s. Key processed data such as plane segmentation, fluorescence traces, and deconvolved traces are available, allowing for detailed analysis of region-of-interest (ROI) dynamics and neural activity patterns.
