# Engineering Luminopsins with Improved Coupling Efficiencies

## Scientific Abstract

In this study, we investigated the electrophysiological properties of various engineered luminopsins to enhance their coupling efficiencies within HEK cells. The luminopsins under study were subjected to intracellular voltage patch clamp recordings to quantify their performance characteristics. The results from these recordings provide insights into optimizing the coupling efficiencies of luminopsins, which is crucial for improving their functional utility in neural modulation applications.

The experiments were conducted by the Hochgeschwender Lab at Central Michigan University, under the supervision of researcher Ashley Slaviero. The data collected were subsequently analyzed as part of the study titled "Engineering luminopsins with improved coupling efficiencies" by Slaviero et al. This work is expected to contribute significantly to the field of bioengineering by offering enhanced tools for optogenetic applications.

## Data Available in the NWB Files

The available NWB files contain comprehensive intracellular voltage patch clamp recordings from HEK cells. The recordings include data from multiple electrodes and devices, although specific details about the device types are not described. Each recording session is mapped out with structured metadata, detailing the experimental setup and the sequence of stimuli applied. The files also feature tables that list the recording stimuli and responses, along with the sequential and simultaneous recordings, providing a thorough dataset for in-depth electrophysiological analysis.

In particular, the NWB files include:
- Intracellular Electrode metadata and recordings.
- Direct responses to the applied stimuli captured via patch clamp technique.
- Detailed tables grouping together stimuli, responses, and sequential recordings metadata.
- A reference to the simultaneous recordings conducted across different electrodes.
