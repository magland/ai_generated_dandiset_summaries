### Abstract

The SLAP2 experiment, part of the OpenScope predictive processing community project, aims to advance our understanding of neuronal processing mechanisms through the use of cutting-edge imaging techniques. Conducted on Mus musculus (house mice) at the Allen Institute, the experiment utilizes the Swept, Confocally-Aligned Planar Excitation (SLAP2) microscope to capture glutamate activity as a response to visual stimuli, specifically drifting gratings. This approach allows for precise, high-resolution imaging of neuronal activity across different regions of interest (ROIs), aiding in the decoding of complex brain functions and predictive processing models.

Central to this experiment is the application of the genetically encoded glutamate indicator, iGluSnFR4, which provides dynamic, real-time visualization of synaptic activity. By presenting various grating stimuli with controlled parameters such as orientation, contrast, spatial and temporal frequencies, this research investigates the detailed neural responses and connectivity involved in sensory processing. The insights derived from these experiments could inform computational models of the brain's predictive mechanisms and enhance our understanding of neural circuitry involved in vision and related sensory modalities.

### NWB File Data Description

The Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files in this Dandiset provide comprehensive data from three key experiments. They contain acquisition data including activity images (standard deviation projection) and mean fluorescence images from two distinct imaging setups labeled DMD1 and DMD2. The datasets also detail various visual stimulus presentations by capturing attributes such as contrast, orientation, spatial and temporal frequencies, and spatial positions.

Additionally, the files offer extensive processed data within the optical physiology module, detailing ROI-specific responses such as fluorescence, Î”F/F, and baseline activity. The image segmentation results include detailed plane segmentation data for ROIs in DMD1 and DMD2, alongside image masks. Such information is critical for analyzing spatiotemporal patterns in neuronal activity associated with sensory inputs.
