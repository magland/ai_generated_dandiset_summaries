## Abstract

This study investigates the effect of pulse voltage on CANCAN focusing of electroporation using electrode arrays of varying sizes. The primary objective was to determine whether adjustments in the amplitude of nanosecond electroporation pulses affect the intensity and spatial characteristics of electroporation across electrode arrays. The experiments utilized a four-electrode configuration with varying pulse amplitudes and frequencies. The research was conducted to better understand the mechanics and optimization of electroporation for various biomedical applications. The study was supported in part by NIH R21EY034258.

Experiments were conducted using Cricetulus griseus - Cricetulus aureus subjects. The electroporation protocol included a 4.8kV initial pulse with subsequent pulses reduced by 12.5%. The pulses were delivered in packets repeated ten times at a frequency of 1Hz, with the protocol being subsequently shifted to initiate pulses from different electrodes. Through fluorescence microscopy imaging, spatial and intensity parameters of the electroporation were analyzed, employing Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash4.0 detectors and Olympus IX3 objectives, utilizing channels such as FITC and DAPI.

## NWB File Data Description

The NWB files contain data from single time-point imaging acquisition using fluorescence microscopy. Each file records the details of the imaging including the type of microscope, detector, and objective used. The files also encompass time-synchronized imaging metadata and specific pulse parameters used during the electroporation experiments. Additionally, the subject details and experimenter information are included along with the pulse protocols. The files provide a comprehensive dataset that illustrates the effects of varying pulse voltages on the spatial and intensity characteristics of electroporation.
