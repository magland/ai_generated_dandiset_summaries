## Abstract

This dataset is part of the study by Tseng et al., 2022, published in "Neuron," which focuses on uncovering neural dynamics in mouse posterior cortical areas during a decision-making task involving virtual navigation. Utilizing two-photon calcium imaging, the researchers recorded the activity of over 200,000 neurons across six cortical areas, including V1 and secondary visual areas, retrosplenial cortex (RSC), and posterior parietal cortex (PPC). The study investigates how different areas of the posterior cortex contribute to making flexible navigation decisions when rules are switched dynamically during the task.

Over the course of the experiment, a total of 300 behavioral and imaging sessions were conducted with 8 mice. The neurons were registered into the Allen Institute Mouse Common Coordinate Framework based on widefield retinotopy, allowing for precise mapping of their locations. Fluorescent labeling with retroAAV targeted either anterior regions such as the anterior cingulate cortex/secondary motor cortex (ACC/M2), striatum, or posterior regions like ACC/M2 and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), providing insights into projection-specific neuronal activity. This rich dataset offers a comprehensive resource for understanding the coding strategies employed by the posterior cortical areas during complex decision-making tasks.

## Data Available in NWB Files

The Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files in this dataset include extensive imaging and behavioral data:

1. **Two-Photon Imaging Data:** Multiple imaging planes with raw and processed calcium activity, deconvolved activity, and dF/F measurements. Imaging sessions include static unmixed images of GCaMP and retrograde labels, such as mScarlet and mTagBFP2.
2. **Behavioral Data:** This comprises time-series data on mouse positions, velocities, trial phases, and reward signals sampled at different frequencies. Recorded metrics include raw forward and lateral velocities, trial numbers, trial phases, and reward timings.
3. **Retinotopy and Widefield Imaging:** Data from widefield retinotopy experiments includes axis phase maps, field sign maps, and vessel images, facilitating the overlay of neuronal activity maps onto anatomical frameworks.
4. **Metadata:** Details on experimental setup, participating institutions, surgeries performed, viruses used for labeling, and specific session parameters.
