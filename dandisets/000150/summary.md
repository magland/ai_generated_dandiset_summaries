In this experiment, designed to examine the neural dynamics of the visual cortex, calcium imaging was performed on mice subjected to various visual stimuli using a 2-photon microscopy approach. Conducted at the Allen Institute for Brain Science, the study focused on recording the activity from distinct cell populations within the primary visual cortex (VISp). The session employed a running wheel encoder to monitor the mice's behavior in conjunction with visual stimulus presentations, which included 'gray' stimuli and dynamic 'movie clips'. This method aimed to elucidate the relationship between visual stimuli and neural response modulations within the mouse visual cortex, furthering our understanding of sensory processing.

The experimental data were collected using a Mesoscope 2P Rig, with calcium signals being captured through fluorescent dyes, allowing for the visualization of neural activity across a defined population of neurons. Detailed temporal dynamics of stimulus presentation and corresponding neural data were captured over a series of intervals. The collected data were processed to assess changes in fluorescence concerning events of interest, identifying distinct patterns of neural responses.

Each NWB file contains comprehensive data, including voltage time series from the running wheel, multiple stimulus presentation timestamps, and processed neurophysiological imaging data. The experimental sessions also provide detailed metadata, including structured information on the imaging plane, process modules such as ophys processing for fluorescence and motion correction, as well as segmented regions of interest (ROIs) for individual neurons characterized by various parameters, including their locations and morphological measurements.
