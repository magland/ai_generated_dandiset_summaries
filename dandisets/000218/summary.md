## Abstract

The mnemonic functions of hippocampal sharp wave ripples (SPW-Rs) have been extensively studied, revealing their significant impact on cortical and subcortical targets. This study investigates the effect of SPW-Rs on the firing patterns of lateral septal (LS) neurons in behaving rats. Our findings indicate that a substantial portion of SPW-Rs are temporally locked to high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) (120-180 Hz) in the LS, particularly during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, followed by waking immobility. Despite the temporal locking, coherence and spike-local field potential (LFP) coupling between the hippocampus and LS were found to be low, suggesting that HFOs are locally generated within the LS GABAergic population. This hypothesis is supported by optogenetic induction of HFOs in the LS, demonstrating their intrinsic origin.

Spiking of LS neurons was found to be largely independent of the sequential order of spiking in SPW-Rs but rather correlated with the magnitude of excitatory synchrony of the hippocampal output. The strong activation of LS by SPW-Rs suggests that LS may play a role in conveying hippocampal population events to its hypothalamic and brainstem targets. These findings enhance our understanding of the functional connectivity between the hippocampus and subcortical structures and could have implications for mnemonic processing and behavioral states in the brain.

## NWB File Contents Description

The dataset includes 26 Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files encompassing a variety of electrophysiological and positional data for six subjects (rats). The types of data available in the NWB files are as follows:

1. **Raw acquisition traces** from multiple electrode groups, with detailed metadata about the electrodes, including their locations within the brain, impedance, and recording devices used.
2. **Position tracking data** of the subjects, capturing movement coordinates in the wheel alternation task.
3. **Local field potential (LFP) signals** processed from the raw electrophysiology recordings.
4. **Unit spike times** for detected neural units, including their spike times and locations within specified brain regions.
5. **Experimental epochs and intervals**, indicating sleep states and trial directions.
6. Various **metadata** such as session identifiers, experimenter names, and related publications.

All electrophysiological data were acquired using multi-shank silicon probes from Neuronexus and digitized with a 20 kHz sampling rate using the Intan RHD2000 system. The NWB files also include detailed descriptions of the experimental setup, filtering techniques, and related hardware.
