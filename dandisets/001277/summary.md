# Abstract

The study investigates the effects of varying pulse durations and protocol delivery frequencies on cell viability and membrane permeability through a technique termed NG-CANCAN Remote Targeting Electroporation. Utilizing a four-electrode array with an inter-electrode spacing of 10 mm, experiments were conducted to assess the impact of electroporation with different pulse durations (300 ns, 600 ns, and 900 ns). Cell monolayers of Mus musculus were exposed to distinct protocols, involving packets of pulses at frequencies adjusted to maintain consistent energy delivery across conditions. The integrity of the cell monolayer was examined using Hoechst staining, while membrane permeability was measured via YoPro-1 uptake. This research aims to refine electroporation parameters to enhance therapeutic applications in biomedical fields, particularly in gene delivery and targeted cell manipulation. The work received partial funding from the National Institutes of Health.

Data suggests a nuanced relationship between pulse duration and cellular responses, with different pulse frequencies yielding variable permeability and cell death rates. Protocols comprised a series of repetitive phases following the initial pulse, leading to a systematic reduction in pulse amplitude. The systematic study's ultimate aim is to optimize electroporation settings for minimal invasiveness and maximal accuracy in cellular engineering applications. Observations indicated the potential for tailored protocols to reduce adverse cellular outcomes while maintaining therapeutic efficacy.

# NWB File Data Description

The NWB files encompass 49 datasets categorized into three primary types. Type 1 files include imaging data obtained from Cy3-DAPI channels, presenting combined imaging recorded two hours post-exposure, utilizing Cy3 for dead cell evaluation via propidium iodide and DAPI for cell nuclei identification. Type 2 files contain pre-exposure imaging data from the DAPI channel, employed to assess cell nuclei and monolayer integrity before electroporation. Type 3 files focus on FITC channel imaging data that capture YO-PRO-1 uptake, employed as a membrane permeability marker, 30 minutes post-exposure. Each dataset offers detailed metadata regarding the experimental setup, imaging instrument specifications, and subject-specific protocol descriptions, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the electroporation impact on cellular integrity.
