## Experiment Summary

The experiment aimed to elucidate the relationship between mesoscopic local field potentials (LFPs) and single-neuron firing across different layers of the primary visual cortex (V1) in behaving mice. Using simultaneous recordings from all layers of V1, the study identified functionally distinct layers and sublayers based on depth of maximum spike power and sink-source distributions of LFPs. Six physiological layers were consistently defined across animals, with layer-specific coherence of gamma oscillations (30-100 Hz) and spike-LFP coupling.

The electrophysiological properties of neurons were found to display unique dependencies on both the layer and brain state. Spike transmission from layer 2/3 cells to layer 5 pyramidal cells and interneurons was stronger during waking states than during non-REM sleep, whereas deep-layer excitatory neurons showed stronger spike transmission during non-REM sleep. Additionally, a subset of deep-layer neurons was observed to be active exclusively in the DOWN state of non-REM sleep. These findings provide a bridge between mesoscopic LFPs and single-neuron interactions with laminar structure in V1, enhancing our understanding of interlaminar dynamics and cortical processing.

## Available Data in NWB Files

The available NWB files include raw acquisition traces stored under group /acquisition/ElectricalSeries and metadata about extracellular electrodes under group /general/extracellular_ephys/electrodes. Each NWB file includes details on electrode filtering, gain, impedance, and spatial coordinates, as well as general device information. The dataset encompasses several types of data such as spike times, amplitudes, firing rates, and coefficients of variation for neuron units. The files also contain processing modules with intermediate data, including classified sleep states, UP-DOWN states, and local field potential (LFP) signals. Some NWB files additionally record laser pulse states for optogenetic and visual stimulation experiments.
