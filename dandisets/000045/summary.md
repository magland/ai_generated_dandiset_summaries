## Abstract

This dataset is generated by the International Brain Laboratory as part of a collaborative effort across multiple institutions to standardize experiments for studying decision-making in mice. The focus of the experiment is to train mice to interact with visual stimuli by rotating a wheel. Mice are shown a visual grating with varying levels of contrast on a screen and are trained to rotate a wheel to move the stimulus from either side of their visual field to the center. By recording and analyzing the mice's responses, behaviors, and the conditions under which they occur, the study seeks to understand the neural mechanisms underlying decision-making processes.

The experiments are precisely designed to capture a range of behavioral and neural data as mice engage in decision tasks. Data collected include the details of wheel movements, camera footage of mouse behavior, and trial-specific information regarding visual stimuli presentations. Analyses are aimed at associating visual stimuli with decision-making behaviors, examining factors like contrast sensitivity, response times, and reward processing.

## Data Description

The NWB files within this Dandiset contain extensive datasets. Metadata includes session descriptors, information about the subjects (mice), experimental protocols, and session IDs. The files also capture specific behavioral events, like choices made, contrasts of stimuli, feedback types, and timing of trials. Other data include wheel movement details, the absolute position of the wheel, and various time markers indicating when certain events occurred during a trial.

Some files also include additional data like audio spectrograms from microphones and raw camera footage. Behavioral time series and epochs are meticulously recorded, detailing every trial's start and stop times, response times, feedback times, and movement onset times. This comprehensive data collection ensures robust analysis and reproducibility of results across different experimental setups.
