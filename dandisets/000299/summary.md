## Experiment Overview

This study aimed to evaluate whether different forms of inter-stimulus pulse variability affect the magnitude of dopamine release in the brain. The experiment was conducted on a Norway rat (*Rattus norvegicus*), utilizing various electrophysiological approaches, including multi-electrode extracellular recordings and spike sorting techniques. Specifically, stimulation trains were delivered at 300 ÂµA to the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) while monitoring dopamine release using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) and single-unit activity through optogenetic probes. Both FSCV and single-neuron recordings were made to determine the neural response to the stimuli.

The rat was not anesthetized initially for about 30 minutes to obtain baseline measurements, but later underwent anesthesia to reduce movement artifacts. Despite the weak FSCV-evoked release, approximately 10 neurons were identified and analyzed for their spike activity during the stimulation sessions. The recording session took place in the labs of Cowen and Heien at the University of Arizona, focusing on the neural correlates of dopamine release and electrophysiological activity under different experimental conditions.

## Available Data in the NWB Files

The NWB file contains various datasets and metadata essential for understanding and reproducing the experiment:
- **Electrical Recordings:** The file includes an *ElectricalSeries* for FSCV across all electrodes, capturing the electrical activity during the experiment.
- **Electrode Metadata:** Details about the electrodes, such as their impedance, labels, and locations (x, y, z coordinates), are provided. Additionally, metadata includes references to electrode groups and filtering descriptions.
- **Devices:** Information about the carbon probe for measuring FSCV, the LFP probe, and the Neuropixels probe used in the experiment.
- **Experimental Intervals:** Time intervals for each sleep stage as determined by EEG recordings, including the confidence in stage classification.
- **Units:** Spike times, sorting quality, and waveform mean for each of the identified spike units.
- **Stimulus and Session Information:** Description of the stimulation trains, session details, and the session start and reference times.
