## Abstract

This dataset encompasses raw calcium imaging data obtained from freely moving Mus musculus, with the primary aim of understanding neuronal activity during exploratory behavior. Using a one-photon miniscope, the experiment captures cell population imaging while the subjects engage in maze exploration. This setup is designed to examine neuronal dynamics in naturalistic, unrestrained settings, potentially shedding light on neural circuit functions related to spatial navigation and memory processes. 

The study involves several recording sessions with different subjects to ensure the robustness of the findings across individual variability. The utilization of one-photon microscopy allows researchers to record large-scale neuronal activity with minimal invasiveness, preserving the animal's natural behavior. This dataset is instrumental for advancing knowledge in neural mechanisms underlying exploration and decision-making processes.

## NWB File Data Description

The Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files in this dataset contain detailed recordings of calcium imaging sessions. Each file documents the activity captured by a one-photon miniscope, focusing on key imaging parameters such as the imaging plane and optical channels used during recording. The files include metadata relating to the experimental sessions, such as session start times and subject identifiers, which are crucial for replicating and understanding the context of the data. Imaging information, including the device details referred to as "My one-photon miniscope," is consistently documented across different recordings, ensuring standardization and reproducibility.
