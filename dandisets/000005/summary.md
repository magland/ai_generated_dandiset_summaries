### Summary of Experiment

This dataset consists of electrophysiological data collected from thalamic and cortical neurons in mice during a somatosensory object location task. Both intracellular and extracellular recordings were performed in the mouse barrel cortex and the ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPM). The primary goal of this investigation is likely to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying whisker-based sensory perception and decision-making processes. The experiment employs chronic Silicon probe recordings to capture the neuronal activity during active tactile behavior, allowing for the identification of principal whisker (PW) contributions to neural responses.

Optogenetic perturbations were incorporated to modulate neural activity, providing insights into causal relationships between specific neuronal populations and behavioral outputs. The comprehensive nature of the recordings, encompassing varied whisker responses and electrophysiological parameters, makes it a valuable resource for understanding somatosensory processing at the neuronal level.

### Available Data in NWB Files

Each NWB file contains data from behavioral and neural acquisition sessions. The data includes TimeSeries of lick traces and principal whisker angles, curvatures, and contacts. Behavioral time-series data reflects the timing of pole availability and whisker interactions. Electrophysiological data captures detailed metadata about the extracellular electrodes, including their location, impedance, and group affiliations. Key datasets include spike times, waveforms, and observational intervals of recorded units, with some files also noting the application of optogenetic stimulation and lick touch events. Trials metadata contain information about timings of events like first lick, pole positions, and photo-stimulation parameters.
