### Abstract

Brain-wide microstrokes, induced by microsphere injections, are hypothesized to destabilize memory circuits in the hippocampus, particularly within the CA1 region. To investigate this, we conducted chronic two-photon calcium imaging on CA1 networks of mice navigating a virtual reality (VR)-based spatial task. Behavioral metrics including running speed, VR position, and licking behavior were recorded to assess the effects of induced microstrokes on cognitive performance. By analyzing the spatial memory and licking response pre- and post-induction of microstrokes, this study aims to elucidate the impact of widespread microlesions on the stability and functionality of hippocampal circuits.

The collected data provides significant insights into the changes in hippocampal network behavior following a controlled brain injury. Utilizing a combination of advanced imaging techniques and detailed behavioral analysis, we aim to create a comprehensive understanding of how microstrokes can alter memory and spatial navigation abilities. This research has the potential to inform therapeutic approaches to mitigate the adverse effects of microstrokes on cognitive functions.

### Data Description

The NWB files contain extensive datasets acquired from chronic two-photon calcium imaging combined with a VR-based spatial navigation task. The main components include:
- **TwoPhotonSeries**: Provides metadata for two-photon recordings including imaging plane and device details.
- **Behavioral Parameters**: Captured running speed, VR position, and licking behavior.
- **Session Information**: Detailed description of experimental trials, including performance metrics like Binned Lick Ratio and Spatial Information from licking histograms.
- **Processed Behavioral Data**: Includes detailed behavioral epochs such as licking intervals, reward zones, and running intervals.
- **Motion-Corrected and Segmented Imaging Data**: Contains dF/F responses for ROIs, image masks, and reference images highlighting functional and anatomical features of the imaged regions.
