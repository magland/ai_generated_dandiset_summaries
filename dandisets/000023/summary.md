### Abstract

Whole-cell Patch-seq recordings were conducted on human neocortical neurons, using specimens obtained by the Allen Institute for Brain Science in June 2020. The main objective of these recordings was to gain a deeper understanding of the electrophysiological properties of human cortical neurons, which can provide insights into human brain function and neurological disorders. The study involves comprehensive intracellular recordings to analyze the response of neurons under different clamp modes and stimuli. These recordings will expand our knowledge of human cortical physiology and could inform the development of more effective therapies for brain-related diseases.

### Data Description

The dataset comprises 318 NWB files totaling approximately 12.4 GB of data. The samples are derived from 56 human subjects and follow the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) data standard. The available data include various voltage and current clamp series, utilizing intracellular electrodes connected to the ITC18USB device from Harvard Bioscience. Each NWB file contains detailed metadata such as session start time, device information, stimulus presentations, and detected spikes. The dataset also includes sweep tables summarizing the PatchClampSeries recordings, test pulse data, user comments, and a lab notebook recording numerical and textual keys associated with the experiments.
