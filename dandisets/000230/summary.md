## Experiment Summary

The dataset "Jacobsen 2022" encompasses a comprehensive examination of the monosynaptic inputs to neurons categorized by their birth dates within the intact brain of Mus musculus. The experiment utilized a combination of behavioral and electrophysiological approaches to elucidate the connectivity and functional characteristics of these neurons. By employing viral tracing techniques, the study aimed to map out the neuronal circuits and their synaptic inputs in relation to the neurons' temporal development.

The experimental protocols involved intricate behavioral paradigms coupled with photostimulation and detailed extracellular electrophysiology recordings. Behavioral data were collected to monitor the animal's position, direction, and speed within an arena, while simultaneous recordings from a 4-tetrode-array provided high-resolution electrophysiological data, including spike sorting and local field potentials (LFP). This integrated approach allows for a multifaceted understanding of how specific neuronal populations interact and form networks over developmental timeframes.

## Available Data in NWB Files

The NWB files associated with this dataset contain rich detail on both behavioral and electrophysiological data. For instance, the behavioral events of the experimental paradigms are meticulously recorded, providing timestamps and event labels. Each file comprises metadata on extracellular electrodes, including filtering descriptions, electrode group references, impedance values, and precise anatomical locations.

Specifically, type 1 files include detailed information on the behavioral modules (e.g., task events, head direction, movement speed) and electrophysiological recordings (e.g., LFP, spike times, and unit quality). Type 2 files similarly encapsulate data on behavioral events and optrode configurations, with additional emphasis on the task descriptions, photostimulation parameters, and preprocessed LFP data. Each NWB file also contributes comprehensive metadata including session descriptions, timestamps, and identifiers, presenting a cohesive framework for understanding the experiment’s scope and outcomes.
