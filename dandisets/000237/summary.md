### Abstract
Thermoregulatory behavior in larval zebrafish involves intricate neural mechanisms that can be explored through high-resolution imaging techniques. In this study, we investigated the responses of certain genetically-modified larval zebrafish strains (nac -/-; Elavl3-H2B:GCaMP6s +/-; vglut2a-mCherry +/-) to varying temperature stimuli. Using two-photon microscopy, the hindbrains of these zebrafish were imaged while subjected to random wave temperature presentations. The aim was to decipher the neural circuitry underlying thermoregulatory response by analyzing calcium dynamics within neuronal populations.

Our experimental protocol involved presenting larval zebrafish with temperature stimuli ranging from 0.005 to 0.075 Hz over 30 z-planes, capturing a temporal resolution of 0.419 seconds per frame. The experimental sessions included pre-stimulus, stimulus, and post-stimulus phases, cumulatively seeking to capture the dynamic neural activity and behavioral responses. This detailed analysis offers insights into the neural processes that are engaged during temperature perception and regulation in larval zebrafish.
