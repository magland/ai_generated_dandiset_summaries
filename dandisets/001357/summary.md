In this study, we employed high-density Neuropixels probes to investigate the neural encoding of shapes and textures in the visual cortex (V4) of two awake macaques. A comprehensive set of 15 geometric shapes was displayed in eight distinct rotations, alongside a series of 40 grayscale textures, including original, contrast-reversed, and spectrally-matched noise versions. This experimental setup enabled us to monitor the selectivity and responsiveness of a large population of neurons within V4, seeking to identify how different visual stimuli are represented in this area. Our findings suggest that neurons displaying shape and texture sensitivity are organized into sparse clusters rather than the previously hypothesized columnar structure, suggesting alternative principles underlying visual processing in V4.

The dataset comprises an extensive collection of Neuropixels electrophysiological recordings, demonstrating the firing patterns and stimulus-associated dynamic changes in neural activity. The NWB files collectively contain information about electrode placements, the specifics of the visual stimuli used, and detailed neuron response patterns. Recorded data include timestamps of experimental sessions, details of electrode groups and locations, as well as neural spike timings for individual units across varying stimulus conditions. These NWB files facilitate in-depth explorations into the spatiotemporal dynamics of V4 neural firing in response to visually presented shapes and textures.
