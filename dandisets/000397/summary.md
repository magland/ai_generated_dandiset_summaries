### Large-scale neural recordings with single neuron resolution using Neuropixels probes in human cortex

Recent advances in multi-electrode array technology have enabled the monitoring of large neuronal ensembles at cellular resolution, predominantly in animal models. However, current methodologies in human neurophysiology are often limited to recordings from a few neurons per penetrating electrode or aggregated signals of thousands of neurons in local field potential (LFP) recordings. In this study, we introduce an innovative probe variant and a set of techniques that facilitate simultaneous recordings from over 200 well-isolated cortical single units in humans during intraoperative neurosurgical procedures utilizing silicon Neuropixels probes. Our findings reveal a diversity of extracellular waveforms with eight distinct single-unit classes, characterized by their firing rates, electrode array positions, waveform spatial spread, and modulation by LFP events such as inter-ictal discharges and burst suppression. Despite some challenges in creating a turnkey system, our high-density silicon arrays offer a novel and powerful avenue for investigating human-specific cognitive processes and their dysfunction with an unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution.

The data available in the NWB files include raw and processed electrophysiological recordings captured using SpikeGLX software. Specifically, the files contain local field potential (LFP) traces and high-pass filtered traces for single-unit activity across 384 electrodes. Detailed metadata about the electrodes, such as channel names, contact shapes, location within the subject (e.g., brain region), and relevant parameters like gain and offset to microvolts, are included. Information on the Neuropixel devices used, such as probe type and associated hardware, is also recorded. The datasets provide granular insights into the spatial properties of electrode groups and their corresponding neuronal activity, taken from human subjects during clinical neurosurgical sessions.
