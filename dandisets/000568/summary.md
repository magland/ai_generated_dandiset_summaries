# Probing subthreshold dynamics of hippocampal neurons by pulsed optogenetics

Understanding how excitatory and inhibitory inputs are integrated by neurons necessitates the monitoring of their subthreshold behavior. This experiment investigated subthreshold dynamics using optogenetic depolarizing pulses in hippocampal neuronal assemblies of freely moving mice. The study documented a decrease in excitability during sharp-wave ripples, which coincided with increased inhibitory input, termed "negative gain." Conversely, optogenetic probing demonstrated increased within-field excitability in place cells by weakening inhibitory inputs, thereby revealing stable place fields in initially non-place cells. 

Neuronal assemblies active during sharp-wave ripples in the home cage were predictive of spatial overlap and sequence in place fields of both place cells and revealed preexisting place fields of non-place cells during track running. This indicates that indirect probing of subthreshold dynamics in neuronal populations allows for the discovery of preexisting assemblies and different modes of neuronal operations.

## Available Data in NWB Files

The NWB files in this Dandiset contain comprehensive data encompassing various aspects of the experiment. These files include video recordings from the Basler camera capturing the movement of mice during experiments. Detailed metadata about electrophysiological recordings are available, including descriptions of the 32-channel electrode devices used. Data captured in ElectricalSeries and ImageSeries document electrical signals and positional tracking, respectively. Several DynamicTables provide metadata about extracellular electrodes and the recording environment.

Key datasets include LFP (Local Field Potentials), spike times, and specific event intervals (e.g., ripples, up/down states). Various metrics related to ripples and high synchrony events are meticulously documented. Optogenetic stimulation data delineates the specifics of the light pulses used for stimulation. Tracking data from positional tracking in videos are processed and included in multiple formats.
