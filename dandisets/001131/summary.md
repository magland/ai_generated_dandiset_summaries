## Abstract

In this study, neural and behavioral annotation data were collected to investigate the role of neuropeptide signaling in encoding a persistent internal state via a line attractor. The experiments were conducted using male Mus musculus (house mouse) subjects in a resident-intruder assay setup. Specifically, the experiments employed GCaMP fluorescent protein to record calcium imaging data, providing insights into neural activity patterns in vivo. This data supports the hypothesis that neuropeptide signaling is crucial for maintaining persistent internal states within neural circuits.

The research utilized a 1-photon miniscope for in vivo calcium imaging of neurons in the VMHvl region of the hypothalamus, which was accompanied by behavioral monitoring. Processed behavioral epoch data, including the intervals of sniffing behavior, and detailed neural traces were collected and preprocessed for subsequent analysis. The dataset, stored in Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) format, aims to facilitate further exploration of the mechanisms underlying internal state encoding and persistence.

## Available Data

The NWB files contain comprehensive data on both neural activity and behavioral annotations. Specifically, the following datasets are included:

- **Calcium Imaging Data**: This includes preprocessed neural trace data in the VMHvl region, captured using a 1-photon miniscope. The calcium imaging data underwent motion correction and CNMFE (Constrained Non-negative Matrix Factorization for Endoscopy) preprocessing.
  
- **Behavioral Data**: Contains processed behavioral data collected at 10 Hz, with timestamps provided in seconds. Behavioral epochs, such as intervals of sniffing behavior, are documented.

- **Latent Factor Analysis**: Dynamic tables detailing the weight contributed by each neuron to a particular latent factor, providing insights into the neural representations associated with the observed behavior.

These datasets are enriched with extensive metadata including experimental descriptions, timestamps, device information, and subject identifiers to support reproducibility and further analysis.
