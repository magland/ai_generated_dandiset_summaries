## Abstract

The neural mechanisms underlying the assignment of positive and negative valence to environmental cues are crucial for survival. Previous research has shown that distinct projections from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) are potentiated following reward or punishment learning, but the routing of valence-specific information to BLA neurons remains unclear. This study investigates the role of neurotensin (NT)-expressing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT), projecting to the BLA (PVT-BLA:NT), in valence assignment during associative learning. Optogenetic activation of PVT-BLA:NT promotes reward learning, whereas knockouts specific to the NT gene (Nts) in the PVT-BLA pathway enhance punishment learning. Additionally, genetically encoded calcium and NT sensors show that both calcium dynamics within this pathway and NT concentrations in the BLA increase after reward learning and decrease after punishment learning.

CRISPR-mediated deletion of Nts in the PVT-BLA pathway diminishes BLA neural dynamics and reduces the preference for active behavioral strategies toward cues predicting rewards or punishments. This research identifies NT as a critical neuromodulator that orchestrates positive and negative valence assignment in the amygdala by extending valence-specific plasticity to behaviorally relevant timescales. These findings highlight the significance of NT in signaling valence in the BLA, contributing a deeper understanding of the neural circuitry involved in adaptive behavior.

## Data Description

The NWB files contain a variety of data sets from in vivo experiments designed to examine the role of neurotensin in valence assignment. These data sets include:
- **Electrical Series Acquisition:** Spike trains recorded from extracellular electrodes implanted in the BLA of mice, capturing neural responses during behavioral tasks.
- **Behavioral Videos:** Videos recorded during Pavlovian discrimination tasks, in which different auditory tones predict sucrose, shock, or no outcome, are presented randomly.
- **Histology Data:** Confocal images showing brain tissue sections that were recorded to corroborate electrode placements and gene expression profiles.
- **Processed Behavioral Data:** Pose estimation data from multiple camera angles, tracking specific parts of the mouse's body (e.g., head, ears, tail) and behavioral ports.
- **Experimental Trials:** Time intervals capturing start and stop times of experimental trials, along with trial types.
