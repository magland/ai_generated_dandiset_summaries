**Abstract**

This study investigates the spatiotemporal dynamics of behavior in freely moving mice, conducted at Emory University under the NIH/NINDS/BRAIN 1 R34 NS137017 grant. By leveraging advanced 3D video tracking technologies, the research primarily aims to decode complex neural patterns associated with naturalistic behaviors in murine models. The experiment, led by Lucas Williamson and Chris Rodgers, focuses on capturing intricate movement dynamics of mice in an unconfined environment, thus offering insights into the neural correlates of navigation and decision-making processes.

The experimental data encompass recordings from multiple camera angles, capturing both intrinsic and extrinsic calibration data to ensure accurate 3D reconstruction of mouse movements. The comprehensive video analysis aims to facilitate a better understanding of mouse behavior and its neural underpinnings, potentially contributing to research areas such as neurodegenerative diseases, behavioral neuroscience, and machine learning models of behavior.

**NWB Files Description**

The NWB files contain extensive information on mouse movement captured from various camera devices, labeled e3v82eb through e3v83e4. Each camera set records both behavioral and calibration sessions, providing essential metadata and video data for in-depth analysis. Intrinsic calibration data ensures that individual cameras record accurate visual fields, while extrinsic calibration data facilitates consistent alignment between multiple camera perspectives. Thus, these files offer a robust dataset for analyzing 3D behavioral patterns in mice, captured during a session identified as "2025-04-17_w5" on January 1, 2025.
