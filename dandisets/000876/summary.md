**Neuropixels SpikeGLX Data for Olfactory Study in Mice**

The dataset "MVMNDA" provides comprehensive Neuropixels SpikeGLX recordings for examining olfactory processing in Mus musculus (house mouse). This dataset, contributed by Horea Christian, features high-density extracellular electrophysiology recordings obtained using advanced multi-electrode arrays. The study captures activity from specific brain regions associated with olfaction, aiming to understand the neural dynamics and circuitry involved in sensory processing.

The Neuropixels probe used in the experiment includes detailed channel information and electrode placements. Electrophysiological signals were recorded via surgical implantation, with data captured in a consistent format to facilitate reproducibility and data sharing. This data supports extensive analysis of neural activities in response to olfactory stimuli, providing a valuable resource for neuroscientific research.

**Data Available in the NWB Files**

The NWB file includes acquisition traces from two primary series: ElectricalSeriesAP and ElectricalSeriesNIDQ. ElectricalSeriesAP includes traces from 384 electrodes, while ElectricalSeriesNIDQ covers 9 channels. Additional metadata is provided for each electrode, including details on channel names, contact shapes, gain to microvolt conversions, and anatomical locations. The dataset also includes information about the Neuropixel device used, electrode groups for shank and NIDQ channels, and subject metadata, ensuring comprehensive coverage of all experimental parameters.
