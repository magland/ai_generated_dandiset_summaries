# State-dependent Processing in Visual Cortex

In this study, extracellular recordings were conducted on the visual cortex of the rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) to investigate the state-dependent processing of visual stimuli. Orientation testing was performed using drifting grating stimuli, while hippocampal EEG recordings were simultaneously acquired to facilitate state scoring. The goal of the experiment was to understand how different internal states, such as sleep or wakefulness, affect the processing of visual information in the cortex.

Data collected included neural activity from various units and electrodes within the visual cortex, alongside LFP and hippocampal EEG signals. This comprehensive approach allows for a detailed examination of the changes in neural coding and communication that occur under different internal states. The insights gained from this study could contribute to our understanding of how the brain adapts its sensory processing mechanisms in response to varying states of consciousness.

## Data Available in NWB Files

The NWB files available in this dataset include detailed metadata and several groups of acquired data. Each file encodes stimuli information, and includes the following groups: 
- **General Devices (sharp electrode)**
- **Extracellular ephys (single electrode, sharp electrode, metadata about electrodes)**
- **Processing Module (Plexon LFP)**
- **LFP (Plexon Electrical Series, Hippocampal EEG)**
- **Units (Autogenerated)**

Specifically, the NWB files contain datasets for electrode groups, electrode locations, spike times, and hippocampal EEG recordings. This data is essential for understanding the fine-scale electrical activity within the visual cortex and its modulation by hippocampal states.
