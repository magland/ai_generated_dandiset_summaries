### Experiment Summary

This study aimed to investigate the effects of different hippocampal stimulation patterns on temporal lobe seizures in non-human primates. Four rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were divided into two cohorts. The first cohort (GIN cohort), consisting of three hemispheres, was implanted with the Medtronic RC+S stimulation and recording system to evaluate three unilateral stimulation patterns: 7 Hz Ring ADMES, 20 Hz Dual Ring, and 125 Hz Dual Ring. The second cohort (EPC cohort) included two subjects implanted with 12-contact segmented electrodes in the right hippocampus connected to an externalized recording and stimulation system, allowing for the evaluation of four different stimulation patterns: 7 Hz Full ADMES, 7 Hz Ring ADMES, 31 Hz Wide Ring, and 31 Hz Dual Ring.

The overall objective likely centered on determining the combination of stimulation parameters that most effectively modulates seizure activity, potentially informing therapeutic strategies for epilepsy treatment. By leveraging the electrophysiological approach and advanced electrode arrays, the study provides a comprehensive examination of the electrical dynamics within the hippocampus during seizure episodes and various stimulation conditions.

### NWB File Data Description

The dataset includes 100 NWB files, predominantly comprising extracellular electrophysiological recordings. In total, there are three specific types of NWB files:

1. **Type 1**: Contains multiple "ElectricalSeries" groups, each with acquisition traces and corresponding electrodes metadata. Each group consists of a "DynamicTableRegion" outlining the electrode array configuration.
2. **Type 2**: Features a single "ElectricalSeries" group with acquisition traces and associated electrode metadata.
3. **Type 3**: Includes two "ElectricalSeries" groups, each containing acquisition traces and their respective electrode regions.

All NWB files share some common elements: descriptions of the devices used (DeviceEcephys), electrode group configurations (ElectrodeGroup), and metadata about the subject and session, including session start time, session ID, and acquisition timestamps.
