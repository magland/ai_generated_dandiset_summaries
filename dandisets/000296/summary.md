# Drosophila Visual Neural Responses to Stochastic Stimuli

Neurons integrate excitatory and inhibitory signals to produce their outputs, but the role of input timing in this integration remains poorly understood. This study investigates motion detection in *Drosophila melanogaster* as it provides a paradigmatic example of such integration relying on different delays in visual signals. By manipulating ion channel expression to speed up or slow down specific neuron types in the motion detection circuit of *Drosophila*, researchers increased the neuronsâ€™ sensitivity to fast or slow visual motion. These manipulations revealed distinct roles for excitatory and inhibitory dynamics in tuning directional signals, highlighting the amacrine cell CT1 as particularly significant. A circuit model constrained by functional data and anatomy qualitatively reproduced the observed tuning changes, offering insights into how excitatory and inhibitory dynamics conjointly tune canonical circuit computations.

The dataset available in the NWB files includes recordings of neural activity collected via two-photon microscopy. Each NWB file contains acquisition data including TwoPhotonSeries, ImagingPlane, Device, and OpticalChannel information. Detailed descriptions of the experimental setup and the subjects (Drosophila melanogaster) are provided along with metadata. Each session is documented with timestamps and identifier information, and was conducted with meticulous surgical and imaging techniques. The collection comprises 100 NWB files of type 1, ensuring a comprehensive repository for analyzing neural dynamics in response to visual stimuli.
