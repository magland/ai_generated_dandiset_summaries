# Abstract

The dataset "Cortical acetylcholine dynamics are predicted by cholinergic axon activity and behavior state" explores the intricate dynamics of acetylcholine (ACh) release in the cortical regions of awake mice. By employing advanced in vivo imaging techniques, this study focuses on simultaneous recordings of ACh signals and GCaMP-expressing axonal activity within the cortex during spontaneous behavioral state changes. This approach enables the dissection of spatiotemporal properties of cortical ACh release and its interrelation with cholinergic axon activity, enhancing our understanding of the neuromodulatory role of ACh in behavior and neural processing.

The study involves the use of a two-photon random access mesoscope to achieve high-resolution imaging of ACh sensor activity in the primary motor cortex, focusing on both green (GACh3.0) and red (rACh1.4) ACh sensors in combination with cholinergic axons projecting from the basal forebrain. The recorded data sheds light on the coordination between ACh release and pupil dynamics, paving the way for integrative models of cortical processing influenced by behavioral states. With support from the National Institutes of Health, this research represents a significant step towards establishing predictive models of ACh dynamics influenced by neural and behavioral variables.

# NWB File Data Description

The dataset comprises 100 NWB files categorized into three types, each capturing distinct aspects of the experimental investigations. Type 1 files focus on the acquisition and processing of eye-tracking and pupil data, treadmill velocity, and imaging data using a green ACh sensor in the primary motor cortex. These files contain detailed fluorescence traces, ROI response series, and image segmentation data essential for understanding the correlations between ACh release and behavioral state changes. 

Type 2 files maintain a similar scope in terms of fluorescence and image segmentation data but do not include eye-tracking or pupil data, focusing instead on ACh sensing in primary motor cortex regions using green sensors. Type 3 files are distinct in that they involve dual-channel imaging with both red and green ACh sensors and GCaMP8s-expressing axons, supplying multi-dimensional data with intricate details on axonal and ACh dynamics across different cortical areas. Across types, data on microscope devices, imaging channels, and processing outputs such as fluorescence and summary images provide a comprehensive view of the experimental setups and results.
