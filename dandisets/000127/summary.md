# Area2_Bump: Macaque Somatosensory Area 2 Spiking Activity During Reaching with Perturbations

This dataset captures neural activity and associated behavioral data from a macaque monkey performing a center-out reaching task with perturbations. The experiment involves using a manipulandum to control a cursor, where on select trials, a mechanical perturbation or "bump" is applied during the center hold period before the reach. Neural data were recorded from a 96-electrode array implanted in the somatosensory area 2. This investigation aims to understand how somatosensory neurons in area 2 respond to and process mechanical perturbations during a reaching task, providing valuable insights for designing better neural decoding algorithms and enhancing brain-machine interface applications. 

Neural data was supplemented with comprehensive behavioral metrics, recording hand position, cursor position, forces applied to the manipulandum, muscle lengths and velocities, as well as joint angles and velocities. This comprehensive dataset is part of the Neural Latents Benchmark providing a rich resource for evaluating models of neural latent dynamics during motor tasks.

## Data Available in the NWB Files

The available NWB files contain:
- Metadata about the electrodes, including their location, impedance, and coordinates.
- Electrophysiological data capturing spike times from individual units and their specific electrodes.
- Behavioral data, including force interactions, hand position and velocity, joint angles and velocities, muscle lengths and velocities.
- Trial-specific data, detailing the start and stop times, directions, bump timing, and trial outcomes.
