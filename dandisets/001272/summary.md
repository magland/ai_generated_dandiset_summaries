# Abstract

The study investigates the use of the voltage-sensitive dye Di8-ANEPPS to assess neuronal sensitivity to 2 kHz sine wave stimulation without the influence of tetrodotoxin. Di8-ANEPPS targets neuronal voltage changes through an electrochromic mechanism distinct from FluoVolt’s photo-induced electron transfer, thus ensuring unbiased measurements of neuronal activity under intense stimulation. The research aimed to validate that the detection of action potentials is not confounded by the dye itself when exposed to unmodulated sine waves. These experiments serve as control studies to ensure the reliability of measurements previously recorded with FluoVolt in similar settings, as documented in other related datasets.

Experiments were conducted using male Rattus norvegicus (Norway rat) specimens under standardized conditions. Neuronal activity was recorded using the TRITC filter cube to visualize action potentials through Di8-ANEPPS in an environment containing a physiological saline solution. Measurements were calibrated considering electrode-induced voltage gradients to ensure accurate voltage application across neurons. This work was part of a broader effort supported by the NIH Brain Initiative to explore neuronal responses to high-frequency electrical stimulation, providing critical insights into the potential applications of non-invasive neuronal sensing and modulation techniques.

# NWB Files Description

The dataset comprises 65 NWB files, each containing data from experiments evaluating the impact of 250 ms, 5.5V amplitude sine waves on neuronal activity. The experiments were conducted without the use of tetrodotoxin, serving as a vehicle control. Data capture included imaging of neuronal action potentials within the subject—a Norway rat—with applied electrical stimulation visualized via the dye Di8-ANEPPS. Each file records neuronal activity in response to a specific sine wave stimulus, with session details documenting the experimental parameters, including subject information, stimulus characteristics, and physiological conditions employed during the measurement sessions.
