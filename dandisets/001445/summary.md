## Abstract

This study investigates the electrochemical properties of G3 electrodes when implanted in vivo over a span of five weeks. The experiment utilized Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), focusing on characterizing EIS parameters such as impedance across various frequencies. A total of 32 differently sized electrodes were deployed across four rats, with sizes ranging from 1 μm to 100 μm. The primary aim was to evaluate how electrode size and duration of implantation affect the electrochemical stability and performance within a biological environment.

EIS measurements are critical for assessing the interface properties between electrodes and biological tissues, crucial for applications like neural recording and stimulation. This research could provide valuable insights into optimizing electrode design for chronic implantation, helping improve the durability and functionality of neural interfaces. The data set curated from this study offers a robust framework for examining the in vivo performance characteristics of micro-scale electrodes over extended durations.

## Data Description

The Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files contain datasets that capture key parameters measured during the EIS experiments. Specifically, the files record the frequency, real part (Z-real), and imaginary part (Z-imaginary) of the impedance at 41 discreet frequency points. The NWB files categorize this data within a DynamicTable format under the acquisition group. Additionally, metadata encapsulated within these files describe the electrodes utilized in the experiment, detailing electrode area, name, material, and placement location. The data also include device metadata and session-specific details such as date, time, and identifiers for each experimental session.
