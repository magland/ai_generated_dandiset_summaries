## UHN Whole-Cell Patch-Clamp Excitability Recordings from Mouse Cortical Neurons

Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were performed on layer 5 cortical neurons from acute mouse brain slices. The primary aim of the experiment was to examine the electrophysiological properties and excitability of neurons in the cortical layer, likely to understand synaptic integration and neuronal response to varying stimuli. These recordings help elucidate the physiological behaviors under conditions that simulate normal and potentially altered brain states to contribute to the understanding of neural excitability and plasticity mechanisms.

Cells were subjected to various current clamp and voltage clamp protocols, which were intended to evoke and record neuronal responses under controlled electrical conditions. This method allows the precise measurement of electrical properties and can identify changes in neuronal behavior when different types of stimuli are applied. For instance, I-V curve protocols and long square pulse protocols were used to characterize the excitability and response dynamics of these neurons.

### Data Available in the NWB Files

The NWB files include detailed current clamp and voltage clamp series recordings from these neurons. Metadata fields provide extensive documentation about each session, including the protocol name, file version, comments on the experimental conditions, and specifics of the intracellular electrodes and devices used. Data include numerous sweeps, each tagged with a sweep number and accompanied by corresponding stimulus presentation series. Each NWB file is thoroughly annotated, containing information about the stimulus and acquisition parameters, aiding reproducibility and deeper analysis of neuronal activity.
