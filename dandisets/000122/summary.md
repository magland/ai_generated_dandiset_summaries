## Abstract

This study investigates the activation of the motor cortex during a finger-tapping task using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Participants were asked to either tap their left thumb to fingers, tap their right thumb to fingers, or perform no tapping (control condition), with each tapping duration lasting for 5 seconds and prompted by an auditory cue. fNIRS sensors were strategically placed over the motor cortex to monitor neuronal activity, with additional short channels attached to the scalp to enhance signal accuracy. The primary goal of this research is to elucidate the specific patterns of motor cortex activation associated with different finger-tapping tasks.

Data was collected from five subjects, with each session meticulously recorded and annotated. Details of the experimental procedure, including sensor placement and stimulus presentation, are documented and available for further review. The fNIRS data provides insights into the hemodynamic responses of the motor cortex during the execution of motor tasks, contributing valuable information on brain-behavior relationships and the functional organization of the motor cortex.

## NWB File Data Description

The available data comprises five NWB files, each containing comprehensive fNIRS recordings from individual subjects during the finger-tapping task. Key data elements include raw NIRS channel data, organized in a NIRSSeries group, and detailed descriptions of the NIRS device and its components, such as optical channels, detectors, and sources. Metadata for each channel includes identifiers, labels, and spatial coordinates, ensuring precise mapping of sensor locations. Additionally, the files contain auditory stimulus presentation data, capturing the timing and nature of the auditory cues used to prompt finger tapping.
