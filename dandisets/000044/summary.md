### Abstract

This dataset comprises eight bilateral silicon-probe multi-cellular electrophysiological recordings conducted on four male Long-Evans rats in the Buzsáki lab at NYU. The primary aim was to investigate the impact of novel spatial learning on hippocampal CA1 neural firing and local field potential (LFP) patterns in naïve animals. Each experiment session involved three main epochs: a pre-maze rest/sleep epoch (~4 hours) in a familiar environment, a novel maze running epoch (~45 minutes) in a novel room where the rats were encouraged to traverse a maze for water rewards, and a post-maze rest/sleep epoch (~4 hours) back in the familiar environment. The mazes were of different designs, including linear and circular platforms, and the animals' positions were tracked using head-mounted LEDs. The experiment assesses both rigid and learned hippocampal sequences in response to novel spatial tasks.

In addition to hippocampal recordings, neck electromyography (EMG) and head-mounted accelerometer signals were recorded to monitor the animals' positions and movements during the maze running epochs. Previous studies related to this dataset explore the diversity in neural firing dynamics and its role in hippocampal sequence learning.

### Available Data in the NWB Files

The NWB files contain detailed metadata about the recordings, including the creation dates, the names of the experimenters, and related publications. Each file describes the electrode groups and their configurations, including information about bad electrodes, filtering techniques, impedances, and positions (x, y, z coordinates). The files also include information on specific epochs, sleep states, and positional data tracked during the maze activities.

The recordings capture extracellular electrophysiology data, including LFP signals and spike times for individual units. The files categorize units based on cell type and brain region, and track the spike times per unit. Behavioral data, such as the (x,y) coordinates of the rat's movement and its linearized position in the maze, are also documented. Additionally, the dataset consolidates this information across different experimental sessions.
