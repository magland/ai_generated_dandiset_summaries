## Experiment Summary

The study explores the neural response patterns of cortical and subcortical visual areas to visual stimuli modulated by white noise sequences, specifically focusing on their temporal precision. Utilizing an electrophysiological approach, the experiment recorded the neural activities in the mouse brain using the OpenScope Neuropixels passive viewing protocol. The stimuli presented were either a full field flicker, where luminance was modulated uniformly across the visual field, or static gratings with time-modulated contrast. A significant finding was the strong response of most cortical visual neurons to the full-field flicker white noise. The novel electrode configuration adopted for approximately half of the mice allowed for capturing large populations of neurons in subcortical regions, enhancing the dataset's comprehensiveness.

This research endeavors to leverage the distinct neural response "barcodes" elicited by repeated white noise stimuli to identify discrete cell types across multiple species and brain regions. The barcodes offer a new perspective for analyzing the precise spike timing and neural circuitry, with potential implications for generative models and information-theoretic analyses. By providing copious neuronal "barcodes" across the mouse brain, the dataset aims to facilitate testing hypotheses regarding cellular identification based on firing patterns and offers a valuable resource for ongoing neuroscientific investigations.

## NWB Files Description

The NWB files include comprehensive datasets derived from the experiment. The first type of NWB file contains detailed datasets on eye tracking, running wheel activity, and metadata on optogenetic stimuli and electrophysiological recordings. Notably, neurological data utilizing Neuropixels 1.0 probes have been documented, capturing spike-timing precision. Additionally, intervals marking presentations and stimulus details for various stimuli, such as full field flicker and static block, are included.

Subsequent NWB file types focus on capturing local field potential (LFP) data from individual electrodes on different probes, further facilitating an in-depth analysis of the neural responses across various brain regions. Each of these datasets provides metadata related to electrode configurations and settings, ensuring precise characterization and facilitation of reproducible analysis of LFP dynamics associated with stimuli presentation and neural activity.
