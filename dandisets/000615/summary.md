# A Novel Neuropathic Pain Treatment: Achieving Neuronal Inhibition with a Split Ring Resonator

## Abstract

This study investigates the potential of using Alternating Microwave-Stimulated Split Ring Resonators (SRRs) to achieve neuronal inhibition in Procambarus clarkii (Red swamp crayfish). The third motor nerve in P. clarkii was exposed to these novel treatments to assess the efficacy of SRR in reducing neuropathic pain signals. The goal was to observe the extracellular action potentials and postsynaptic potentials during the treatment and establish a viable method for inhibiting neuronal activity through SRR stimulation.

Over the course of multiple sessions, extracellular action potentials and postsynaptic potentials were recorded to determine changes in neuronal activity. The data were analyzed to explore the effectiveness of SRR as a novel method for potential neuropathic pain treatment. These findings contribute significant insights into alternative pain management therapies and hold promise for future applications in clinical settings.

## Data Description

The dataset encompasses three Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files capturing the neuronal activities from multiple sessions, each consisting of a variety of time series recordings. One file contains data from a session conducted on 2022-04-11, another from 2022-05-26, and the final one from 2022-07-06. Each file includes multiple TimeSeries recordings of action potentials (AP) and postsynaptic potentials (PSP) spanning up to 131 and 131 channels respectively, although individual descriptions for each TimeSeries are not provided. The recorded data measures the responses of the third motor nerve in P. clarkii under the influence of alternating microwave-SRR stimuli.
