## Summary of Experiment

The experiment investigates the temporal dynamics of cFos transcription in the mouse brain using HaloTag technology. A TRE::HaloTag-NLS construct was used in tet-tag mice, which were subsequently injected intravenously with HaloTag-ligand-JF669 on the first day and HaloTag-ligand-JF552 on the second day. This approach allows for the temporal labeling of cFos expression, providing insights into the activation patterns of neurons in response to different stimuli or conditions. 

The use of two-photon microscopy facilitates high-resolution, cellular-level imaging of brain slices, offering a detailed view of cFos transcriptional activity across different brain regions. The collected data aims to elucidate the temporal and spatial dynamics of neuronal activation, contributing to our understanding of gene expression in neuronal circuits.

## Description of Available Data

The available data are stored in three NWB files, each containing imaging data acquired through two-photon excitation microscopy. The dataset includes various components such as the TwoPhotonSeries, ImagingPlane, OpticalChannel, and Device information necessary for interpreting the imaging data. The imaging data captures intricate details of cellular activity across different time points, utilizing two-photon microscopy for high-resolution imaging.

Each NWB file provides a detailed record of the experimental conditions, including the specific time points of cFos transcription labeling, device configurations, and the method of data acquisition. The files also contain metadata about the subjects, the neuroimaging devices used, and the specific optical channels through which data were collected.
