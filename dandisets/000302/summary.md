## Experiment Summary

The study aims to investigate the neurophysiological properties of the medial habenula in mice, particularly focusing on Tac1 neurons during reward-seeking tasks. Utilizing a combination of electrophysiological recordings with Neuropixels 2.0 probes and optogenetic stimulation, researchers recorded neural activity while subjects performed tasks designed to trigger reward-seeking behavior. Transcranial optotagging was employed to isolate the function and response properties of Tac1 neurons. The experiments were conducted at Stanford University under the supervision of Dr. YoungJu Jo and funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

The data encompass multiple sessions, during which specific behavioral events such as licking and receiving rewards were meticulously recorded. The electrophysiological data were then analyzed to differentiate neuron firing patterns, including metrics like average firing rates, inter-spike interval violations, and optotagging response probabilities. By targeting and manipulating Tac1 neurons, the study aims to elucidate the neuro-behavioral circuits underlying reward-seeking behaviors in the medial habenula.

## Available Data in NWB Files

The NWB files contain various types of data capturing the breadth of the experiment. Key components include:

1. **Electrophysiological Recordings**: Data from Neuropixels 2.0 4-shank probes, detailing electrode locations, firing rates, spike times, and spike sorting metrics.
2. **Optogenetic Stimulation Data**: Records of pulse frequencies, power, onset and offset times, and widths for both individual stimulation pulses and 1-second stimulation blocks.
3. **Behavioral Data**: Time-stamped records of licking and reward events, linked to trial intervals with labels indicating trial type (reward, no reward, or perturbation).
4. **Metadata**: Detailed descriptions of devices used, experiment protocols, and subject information.
5. **Analysis Data**: Ongoing processes such as optotagging metrics and various quality control measures related to the recorded neurons.
