## Abstract

This study investigates the role of dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens during instrumental learning, conceptualized through the lens of Bayesian inference. By examining dopamine signaling in mice, this research aims to elucidate how probabilistic learning processes are mediated by dopaminergic modulation. The use of fiber photometry allowed for real-time monitoring of dopamine release, as mice engaged in a probability switch task (Probswitch) designed to assess their decision-making strategies in a dynamically changing environment. The experiment is situated within the broader context of understanding the neurobiological foundations of learning and adaptation, particularly how the brain updates beliefs in response to evidence.

The experiment deployed dual-color fiber photometry to capture neural activity specific to the nucleus accumbens. The setup consisted of alternating excitation wavelengths (415 nm and 470 nm) to distinguish between calcium-mediated signals associated with dopamine release. Mice were subjected to trials where the action contingencies shifted unpredictably, allowing for the measurement of reward prediction error, a critical component in Bayesian learning frameworks. The findings are anticipated to contribute substantially to the canonical model of motivation and reinforcement, emphasizing the predictive capacity of the dopaminergic system.

## NWB File Data Description

The NWB files contain extensive datasets capturing various stages and aspects of the experiment. Type 1 files, representing a majority of the dataset, include fiber photometry data captured at 415 nm and 470 nm excitation sources. These files detail the experimental trials, including timestamps corresponding to various actions (such as center in/out, side in/out), block numbers, outcomes, and reward conditions. Each dataset also provides the stereotactic coordinates for fiber placement in the brain, linking signal data to specific anatomical sites.

Type 2 files similarly document trial-level data, with a focus on session-specific variables and response outcomes during the probability switch task. These files are central to understanding the temporal dynamics of mouse behavior in relation to neural activity. Data is organized around trial intervals, tracking specific actions and responses of the subjects, ensuring thorough documentation of each session's protocol.
