In a study seeking to understand the role of environmental cues on memory and decision-making processes, electrophysiological and behavioral data were collected from mice navigating a virtual reality Y-maze. The experiment involved head-fixed mice that were trained to perform a memory-based decision-making task. In this task, mice navigated between two possible paths using visual cues in a Y-maze setup. Typically, an initial visual cue signaled the final reward location, which the mice had to remember through a delay period. In some trials, however, a second cue was introduced, requiring the mice to shift from their initial remembered location to a new path, showcasing the animal's ability to adapt to new information and update their memory-guided decisions on the fly.

Electrophysiological recordings were made from the hippocampal CA1 and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) using multi-electrode arrays to capture neural activities. These brain regions are pivotal in navigation tasks and memory processing. The data set supports findings from Prince et al., 2025, indicating that new environmental information can trigger neural adaptations, allowing animals to adjust their navigational planning and decisions flexibly. This research not only sheds light on fundamental neuroscience questions about navigation and memory adaptation but also provides a basis for understanding complex behaviors in varying sensory environments.

The NWB files in this dataset consist of 66 files holding both raw and processed data. Raw electrophysiological data were captured using a SpikeGadgets acquisition system, and the files include time series data of licks, velocities along a spherical treadmill, and electrical recordings with metadata on electrode configurations and probe placements. Processed data include local field potentials, decomposed into various frequency bands, and behavioral data linked with neuronal activity, including timestamps of different behavioral epochs and trials. This comprehensive dataset allows researchers to examine the link between behavior and neural activity during decision-making tasks in dynamic environments.
