## Experiment Summary

In this experiment, a house mouse (*Mus musculus*) was trained to associate a reward with a particular context in a familiar environment. Subsequently, the reward was unexpectedly removed for a few trials to study the effects on the mouse's behavior and neural activity. After this extinction phase, the reward was reinstated. This experimental design likely aimed to understand the neural mechanisms underlying reward expectation and the behavioral and neural adaptations following an unexpected change in reward contingencies.

The experiment was conducted at the Sheffield Lab, University of Chicago, using a 2-photon (2-p) microscopy rig. Fluorescence imaging was employed to monitor neural activity across different cell populations within the mouse brain. The neural data was processed using Suite2p to generate segmented fluorescence traces for each cell.

## Available Data

The NWB file contains a comprehensive dataset from the experiment, including the following key components:
- **Raw Fluorescence Data**: Time series data of raw fluorescence traces for each cell obtained post Suite2p processing.
- **Device Information**: Details on the Sheffield Lab 2-photon rig used for imaging.
- **Optophysiology Data**: Data regarding the imaging plane and optical channels used during the experiment.
- **Subject Information**: Metadata about the subject mouse, identified as NR6.
- **Experiment and Session Information**: Description, start time, and timestamps reference time for the session titled "Reward expectation extinction."
