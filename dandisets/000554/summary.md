## Scientific Abstract

This study investigates the high-spatial resolution recording capabilities of multithousand-channel PtNRGrids in mapping the spatiotemporal dynamics of neural activity. PtNRGrids, comprising a square-shaped array of 1024 channels with a 150-Âµm pitch, were implanted on the surface of the right primary somatosensory barrel cortex in Norway rats. To evoke sensory responses, air puffs were delivered through a microcapillary tube to stimulate individual whiskers on the contralateral side. This approach demonstrates the capacity of PtNRGrids to isolate functional cortical columns at a sub-millimeter resolution, providing significant insights into the intricate dynamics of cortical activity.

The goal of the experiment was likely to explore and establish the effectiveness of PtNRGrids in mapping neural activity with unprecedented spatial precision. By focusing on sensory stimulation and corresponding cortical responses, the study aims to elucidate the fine-scale functional organization of the somatosensory cortex. The results promise to advance our understanding of cortical processing and offer potential applications in neuroscience research and clinical diagnostics.
