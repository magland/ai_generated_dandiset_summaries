## Depth Dependence of 1P and 2P Fluorescence

This dataset investigates the depth dependence of one-photon (1P) and two-photon (2P) fluorescence in vivo using the JEDI-2P voltage indicator. Data were collected from Mus musculus (house mouse), focusing on depths ranging from the surface to 500 µm. The primary objective is to elucidate the relationship between fluorescence signals and tissue depth, which is crucial for optimizing imaging techniques in neuroscience research. The experiments were conducted in the Adam Cohen Lab at Harvard University, with in vivo measurements taken under controlled conditions.

Fluorescence measurements include static snapshots captured from different depths to compare the performance of 1P and 2P techniques. The research aims to provide insights that could enhance the understanding of optical properties and signal detection in biological tissues, contributing to more accurate and efficient in vivo imaging methodologies. The dataset is valuable for researchers interested in the optimization of voltage indicators and the comparative assessment of imaging modalities.

### Available Data in NWB Files

The dataset comprises 51 NWB files, which are categorized into two types. Type 1 NWB files contain acquisition data in the form of static grayscale images from 2P snapshots at varying depths, with an example specifying a depth of 150 µm. These files include metadata such as the file creation date, experimenter, institution, laboratory, and subject identifier.

Type 2 NWB files are more comprehensive, featuring time series data and image series from various acquisition devices, including Confocal, DMD, and SLM systems. These files also contain metadata detailing experiment descriptions, device specifications, session information, and subject identifiers. Notable elements include time-series data from devices like ALP_DMD_Device and Meadowlark_HDMI_SLM, which facilitate detailed analysis of fluorescence changes over time.
