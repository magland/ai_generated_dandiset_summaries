## Experiment Summary

This experiment involves recorded calcium imaging data from zebrafish (*Danio rerio*), designed to study embodied neural visuomotor circuits within neuromechanical simulations and a zebrafish robot setup. The use of calcium imaging facilitates detailed investigation of neuronal population activity by capturing fluorescence signals indicative of neural activity. The dataset records one zebrafish subject, aiming to elucidate the interplay between visual stimuli and neuromotor responses.

The primary goal appears to be understanding how neural circuits integrate sensory inputs to drive motor behaviors, potentially leveraging the robotic platform for controlled stimulus delivery and motor output analysis. This experimental framework helps in dissecting the sensory-motor processing pipeline, paving the way for insights into fundamental neurobiological principles underpinning visuomotor integration.
