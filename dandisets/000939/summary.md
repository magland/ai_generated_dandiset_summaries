### Large-scale Recordings of Head-direction Cells in Mouse Postsubiculum

In this experiment, 64-channel linear probe recordings were conducted in the mouse postsubiculum, a brain region characterized by narrowly tuned excitatory cells that are sensitive to the animal's head direction. The study involved 31 mice, with each mouse undergoing one recording session, capturing between 42 to 185 units per session. The sessions included three fundamental epochs: a square open field exploration, followed by two sleep epochs. Some sessions additionally incorporated triangular open field epochs or an optogenetic stimulation epoch. The goal was likely to characterize the head-direction cells' activity under various conditions and stimulus types, aiming to understand how these cells contribute to spatial navigation and potentially their role in neural networks during sleep.

The NWB files obtained from the sessions contain comprehensive datasets, including timestamps of detected units, mean waveforms, local field potentials (LFP), animal position, head-direction data, sleep scoring data (REM/NREM), and accelerometer data. Specific details about the experiment, such as filtering techniques and electrode metadata, are also included. Moreover, some files provide optogenetic stimulation data, adding another dimension to the functional characterization of head-direction cells. The metadata from each file enriches the dataset, offering critical insights for data analysis and reproducibility.
