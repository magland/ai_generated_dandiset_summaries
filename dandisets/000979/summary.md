# Impedance Spectroscopy Dataset

## Scientific Abstract
Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) was employed to investigate the impedance characteristics of an electrode system. Utilizing a potentiostatic EIS experiment, the primary aim of the study was to obtain frequency-dependent impedance data, including real and imaginary components, to elucidate the electrochemical properties of the system under study. The experimental setup was designed for in vitro conditions, managed by researcher Yupeng Wu, and aimed at enhancing the understanding of how different frequencies impact the impedance behavior of the studied electrodes.

The dataset includes impedance measurements across a range of frequencies, assisting in the identification of key electrical properties such as capacitance and resistance. The in vitro analysis provides a controlled environment for understanding fundamental electrochemical characteristics, which are essential for applications in sensors, batteries, and other electrochemical devices. This dataset can be instrumental for researchers aiming to model the impedance behavior of similar electrode systems or in the development of new materials with desirable electrochemical properties.

## Data Available in the NWB Files
The NWB files contain detailed data from the EIS experiments, including:
- **Frequency Data:** A dataset of frequencies (shape: 57, dtype: float64) at which impedance measurements were taken.
- **Impedance Data:** Real (Z-real) and Imaginary (Z-imaginary) impedance values (shape: 57, dtype: float64 for each).
- **Electrode Information:** Metadata about extracellular electrodes including area, label, group, location, material, and units.
- **Device Information:** Details about the GAMRY device used for measurements.
- **Session Information:** Session ID, start time, and timestamps reference time.
