## Abstract

This experiment investigates the effects of aversive stimuli and ketamine on brain-wide electrophysiological activity in humans. Leveraging intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG), the study aims to map the neural responses across various brain regions in response to stressful stimuli, such as an air puff, under both normal and ketamine-influenced conditions. Ketamine, known for its dissociative anesthetic properties, is examined for its potential modulatory effects on stress-related neural circuits. This investigation likely addresses the broader topic of how pharmacological agents can alter neural networks and behavior, which may provide insights into the treatment of mood disorders.

The experiments are conducted using advanced neuroimaging and data analysis techniques, including Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), to decompose the electrophysiological data into interpretable components. This comprehensive approach is designed to elucidate the dynamic and complex interactions between different brain networks in both baseline and altered physiological states induced by ketamine. The findings are expected to contribute to understanding the neural basis of emotion regulation and psychiatric disorders.

## Data Description

The NWB files contain a rich dataset comprising multiple electrophysiological recordings from human participants and mice, focusing on regional brain responses to aversive stimuli and the effects of ketamine. Specifically, the data include spectral analyses of EEG recordings, using techniques such as multitaper spectrograms and NMF. The dataset encompasses change spectrograms and contours mapped to specific brain regions, as well as channel-specific and trial-wise spectral responses. The files also include frequency and time dimension labels to facilitate combinative and temporal analyses of the neural data.
