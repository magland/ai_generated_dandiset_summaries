# IHC Validation Data

## Summary

The dataset titled "IHC Validation Data" comprises confocal images of constrained CDI (Conjugate Directional Immunohistochemistry) and commercially available antibodies targeting identical proteins in mouse and human brain tissues. The aim of this study is likely to validate the efficacy and specificity of the CDI antibodies in comparison to standard commercially available antibodies, providing an essential benchmark for researchers using these tools in neurobiological research. This validation is crucial as it assures the reliability and reproducibility of experimental results where these antibodies are applied.

Confocal microscopy was employed to capture high-resolution, detailed images of brain tissues stained with both CDI and commercial antibodies. Comparative analysis across these samples would elucidate differences or similarities in staining patterns, localization, and signal intensity, thus confirming the robustness of CDI antibodies in detecting target proteins within complex brain tissue matrices. The validation process using human and mouse samples allows for broader applicability of the results across different species, enhancing the utility of CDI antibodies in diverse research contexts.

## Available Data

This dataset includes data conforming to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) standard. The 50 files, totaling approximately 9.99 MB, encompass data from 24 different samples derived from 2 subjects (one human and one mouse). The files contain detailed confocal microscopy images. While specific measurement techniques and variables measured are not detailed, the contents support a comprehensive analysis of antibody validation through visual and quantitative comparison.
