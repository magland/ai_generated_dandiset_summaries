## Abstract

This dataset explores the role of the cortico-cerebellar loop in motor planning using extracellular recordings from the anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) in house mice. The experiment was conducted at the Janelia Research Campus and primarily involved optogenetics and electrophysiological techniques. The recordings, which were thoroughly documented by Nuo Li and his team, aim to uncover the specifics of neuronal activity during different phases of motor planning, specifically examining how optical stimulation of rats influences cortical neuron firing patterns.

## Available Data

The dataset includes 54 NWB files, divided into three types. These files contain comprehensive details of the experiment, including metadata about devices, electrodes, and other recording conditions. Specifically, the NWB files contain information on the following:
- Device specifications, including NN 32ch and Cambridge NeuroTech 64ch probes.
- Metadata about extracellular electrodes, such as location, impedance, and coordinates.
- Detailed recording data, including spike times, waveform means, and standard deviations.
- Optogenetic stimulation sites and virus details, specifically the use of AAV2-hSyn-hChR2(H134R)-EYFP.
- Trial interval data, including cue times, sample periods, and subject responses.
