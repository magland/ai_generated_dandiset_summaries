### Abstract

Understanding the integration of short-latency auditory pathways within the cortical circuits is essential for elucidating neural auditory processing. This experiment investigates the neural activity in the inferior colliculus of the mouse brain, an integral component in the auditory pathway, during auditory stimuli. Using linear probe recordings, researchers aim to characterize the responses of neurons within the inferior colliculus to click sound presentations. Such studies could lend insights into how auditory information is processed at subcortical levels before being relayed to higher auditory centers, thereby contributing to our broader understanding of auditory functioning and potential links to auditory-related disorders.

The data consists of electrophysiological recordings collected from a 64-channel Open-Ephys Cambridge probe and a Neuropixels 1.0 probe deployed across multiple sessions. The probe traces are accompanied by corresponding histological images that reveal sub-cellular positioning. The recordings are meticulously sorted to discriminate between single- and multi-unit activities, providing a detailed map of spike times response to auditory stimuli. By mapping neuronal activity within the inferior colliculus, the experiment elucidates the principles of neuronal coding under transient auditory stimuli and seeks to delineate the synaptic architecture that supports rapid auditory processing.

### Available Data Description

The NWB files include comprehensive datasets containing the histological images of the probe trajectory and the recorded neural data. Across multiple NWB files, the organization and composition of the probe's electrodes (including their positions and dimensions) are systematically logged. Key experimental variables recorded include unit activities such as spike times and the corresponding electrodes with which each unit's activity is associated. These datasets provide detailed numeric representations of neuronal responses, including spike sorting classifications (single-unit versus multi-unit), spike times, and waveform indices. Each file further documents the experimental setup, session identifiers, and trial intervals, with specific emphasis on distinguishing trial start and stop times.
