### Simultaneous Electroencephalography, Extracellular Electrophysiology, and Cortical Electrical Stimulation in Head-Fixed Mice

In this set of experiments, neural signals were recorded using an electroencephalography (EEG) array and Neuropixels probes while directly stimulating the cortex electrically in awake and anesthetized head-fixed mice. The experiments, detailed in Claar, Rembado et al., 2023, involved recordings both when the mouse was awake and free to rest or move on a rotating disc and under induced anesthesia. Anesthesia was administered using isoflurane, initially at 5% for induction and subsequently maintained at 1-1.5%, before delivering another series of stimuli. For some subjects, an additional series of stimuli was administered during a recovery epoch post-anesthesia.

Each session file includes data such as raw EEG signals from 30 surface electrodes, raw local field potential (LFP) signals from all electrodes on Neuropixels probes, spike times for neuronal units passing a quality threshold, behavioral data on the subjectâ€™s speed, and epoch markers for anesthesia phases. The dataset also encompasses a trial table detailing every stimulus delivered, with some sessions administering visual stimuli interleaved with electrical stimulation trials. Not all sessions included a recovery epoch, yet every session included an awake and an isoflurane epoch.

### Available Data in NWB Files

The NWB files contain a rich array of neurological and behavioral data. Notably, EEG data from a 30-channel array and LFP data from Neuropixels probes (up to three probes per session) are available. Alongside raw electrical data, extensive metadata about the electrodes, including their physical positioning and referencing details, are documented. The files also include spike-sorted unit data with associated spike times, waveforms, and quality metrics such as amplitude cutoffs and inter-spike interval violations. Behavioral data quantifying the mouse's running speed and trial-specific information on electrical stimulation and visual stimuli are also included. Detailed experiment session descriptions and timestamps benchmarked to reference times provide comprehensive temporal context.
