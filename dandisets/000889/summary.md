### Abstract

The "Thermal Plaid Replay Experiments - steep gradients" study employs larval zebrafish to investigate how they navigate a virtual thermal environment mimicking real-world complexity. Utilizing replay paradigms, the investigation leverages pre-recorded navigational patterns of zebrafish traversing an infrared-stimulated thermal plaid within a controlled chamber. This type of replay format provides an opportunity to explore sensorimotor and cognitive responses to thermal changes and assesses the extent to which prior navigational experiences shape future directions. By inducing steep thermal gradients, the experimental design challenges zebrafish with dynamic environmental stimuli, focusing on understanding behavioral flexibility and adaptation.

Data collection is meticulously organized, reflecting both behavioral and stimuli-related metrics. Notably, the study draws attention to the crucial role of temporal resolution and spatial precision in behavioral tracking, facilitated by an advanced laser tracking rig. The experimental conditions, such as habituation and gradient exposure periods, are crucial for assessing instant and prolonged responses to spatial thermal patterns, providing insights into navigational decision-making processes potentially translatable to broader species studies.

### Description of NWB Files

The NWB files encapsulate comprehensive datasets from the thermal plaid replay experiments involving zebrafish. Key elements include the aquarium's structural overview and a detailed arena track, highlighting swimming patterns extracted from raw data. The files document the experimental infrastructure, notably the laser tracking rig, which facilitates precise monitoring of fish position and movement. Behavioral data, structured into processing modules, track variables such as the cumulative tail angle, fish heading, and positional information within the chamber. Detailed session parameters and timestamps ensure reproducibility and facilitate longitudinal analyses across different experimental conditions.
