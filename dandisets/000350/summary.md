### Abstract
When an animal's behavior repeatedly fails to achieve its desired outcome, it often results in a switch to a passive state, possibly as a strategy for energy conservation or reassessment of strategies. This study aims to explore the neural mechanisms underlying such behavioral transitions in larval zebrafish. Utilizing a virtual reality setup where visual feedback from swim attempts was deliberately withheld, the zebrafish exhibited prolonged periods of passivity following bouts of failed attempts. Whole-brain calcium imaging revealed two critical components in this process: noradrenergic neurons that specifically respond to unsuccessful swim attempts and radial astrocytes whose calcium activity accumulates with increasing failure. Further experiments involving cell ablation and optogenetic or chemogenetic manipulations demonstrated that the activation of brainstem radial astrocytes by noradrenergic neurons is essential for this switch, indicating that radial astrocytes perform a critical computation by accumulating evidence of motor failure and subsequently suppressing swimming behavior.

### Data Description
The NWB files encapsulate comprehensive datasets from the experiments on larval zebrafish, including both neuron and glia whole-brain calcium imaging, stimulated and recorded using advanced microscopy techniques. The data encompass raw signals for various stimulus parameters, synchronization signals, motor output recordings via electrodes, and processed data that delineate behavioral states and swim intervals. Specifically, these files contain high-resolution images from both neuron and glia-specific optical channels, time series tracking various stimuli and responses, and processed regions of interest (ROIs) data segmented from the high-resolution images. The data also feature identification and timing of activity states, swim intervals, and burst events, providing a detailed account of both raw and processed neural and behavioral data.
