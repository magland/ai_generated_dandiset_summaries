## Abstract

The hippocampus is known for its roles in cognitive and endocrine functions. To explore the potential connection between these functions, we recorded electrophysiological activity from the hippocampus and monitored interstitial glucose concentrations in freely behaving rats. Our findings indicate that clusters of sharp wave-ripples (SWRs) in the hippocampus can predict a reduction in peripheral glucose levels within approximately 10 minutes. This relationship was consistent regardless of circadian, ultradian, or meal-induced fluctuations and could be replicated using optogenetically induced hippocampal ripples, but not those triggered in the parietal cortex. Furthermore, this effect was mitigated by selectively inhibiting the activity of the lateral septum, a critical pathway between the hippocampus and hypothalamus. These results suggest a novel role for the hippocampal SWR in modulating peripheral glucose homeostasis and provide a potential mechanism linking sleep disturbances with glucose dysregulation observed in type 2 diabetes.

## Data Description

The dataset includes 58 NWB (Neurodata Without Borders) files. These files contain electrophysiological recordings and glucose level monitoring data captured from freely moving rats. The specific contents of the NWB files include raw electrophysiological data, accelerometer data, and interstitial glucose concentration readings, captured using the Intan RHD2000 system and the Medtronic iPro2 Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) system. The data files were processed to include information such as local field potentials (LFP), identified ripple events, and sleep state classification.
