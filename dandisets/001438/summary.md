### Abstract

This study investigates the apparent flexibility in spatial learning strategies employed by aged rats during the acquisition of the Morris Water Maze (MWM) task. On alternating trials, the subjects were analyzed for their propensity to switch between allocentric navigation, relying on distant cues, and procedural strategies that depend on self-motion cues and habitual responses. This investigation highlights the persistent adaptability of older rats in employing multiple cognitive strategies throughout successive learning trials. Understanding these strategic alternations may offer insights into the aging brain's capacity for cognitive flexibility and have implications for understanding age-related changes in spatial learning and memory.

The Morris Water Maze is a widely used experimental procedure for assessing spatial learning and memory in rodents. In this experiment, extensive data were gathered on aged rats to unravel how they consistently switch between different cognitive strategies. By quantifying parameters such as goal-crossing frequencies, path efficiency, latency to reach the target, and spatial occupancy metrics, this study provides a comprehensive examination of the rats' performance dynamics and decision-making processes across learning sessions.

### NWB File Data Description

The NWB file contains a detailed log of experimental trials from the Morris Water Maze task involving 2472 unique data points. It includes metadata such as the subject's identifiers and timestamps reference times for the session. Key datasets recorded in these trials include the age and cohort of the subjects, spatial metrics like path length, latency to goal, distance from the goal, and behavioral metrics like chaining, circling, and perseverance. Performance parameters such as initial heading error, efficiency of navigation, and strategic use of space are also quantified. Additionally, temporal metrics such as start and stop times of each trial, time spent in various zones of the maze, and velocity provide insight into temporal patterns of behavior. These datasets capture the nuanced strategies and spatial learning abilities in older rats, offering a rich resource for understanding cognitive flexibility and dynamics in aging subjects.
