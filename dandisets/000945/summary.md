### Abstract

This study investigates the neural responses in the somatosensory cortex of awake, head-fixed rats to transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) stimulation. Different pulse repetition frequencies (PRFs) of ultrasound were tested using a 128-element random array ultrasound transducer. The primary aim was to understand the frequency-dependent effects of tFUS on somatosensory cortical activity. Chronic electrophysiological recordings were performed using 32-channel NeuroNexus electrodes, chronically implanted in the rat brain. The experimental protocol involved delivering ultrasound stimulation every 2.5 seconds with a 10% jitter across 500 trials. Various PRFs including 30 Hz, 300 Hz, 1500 Hz, 3000 Hz, and 4500 Hz were tested, each with a 200 Âµs pulse duration and a 67 ms ultrasound duration. Comparative recordings were also performed under 2% isoflurane anesthesia.

This dataset comprises recordings from ten male rats, initially subjected to trials at 8-10 months of age, with some subjects retested at 12 months. Each subject underwent recordings across different PRFs, with some subjects having duplicate recordings taken several months apart. Recordings characterized by excessive noise were excluded. The data files include spike time data with cell type labels and time series data marking the onset of each tFUS trial, organized by subject and PRF.

### Data Description

The NWB files incorporated in this dandiset contain comprehensive electrophysiological data recorded during the tFUS experiments. Key data elements include details of the electrodes used (e.g., coordinates, impedance), trial onset and offset times, and spike times indexed by neuron units. Each file also contains metadata such as session descriptions, device information, and subject identifiers. Additionally, the data structure supports annotations of cell type labels, distinguishing between different neuronal response types (e.g., regular spiking units, fast spiking units).
