## Summary of Experiment

The dataset provided by Joshi et al. (2023) investigates the relationship between hippocampal spatial representations and the stepping rhythm in rats. The experiments were carried out using male Rattus norvegicus (Norway rats) as the subjects, focusing on the dynamic synchronization between neuronal activity in the hippocampal CA1 region and motor behaviors during locomotion tasks. The primary objective is to understand how hippocampal activity patterns, particularly theta oscillations, align with the rat's gait during movement along linear or W-shaped tracks.

The study employed multi-electrode extracellular electrophysiology recording techniques to capture high-fidelity, temporal neural data. This was complemented by simultaneous behavioral tracking to map out how neuronal firing synchronizes with specific phases of the stepping cycle. Such integrative experimental designs offer valuable insights into the neural coding mechanisms underlying spatial navigation and motor coordination.

## Data Available in NWB Files

The dataset consists of 19 NWB files categorized into various types based on their unique experimental setups. These files include extensive electrophysiological recordings comprising:
- Extracellular voltage recordings captured via multi-electrode arrays, documenting voltage fluctuations across various brain regions.
- DynamicTableRegions and metadata detailing the spatial localization, impedance, and configuration of electrodes.
- TimeIntervals data partitioning experimental epochs based on start and stop times.
- Behavioral data encapsulated within the ProcessingModule, documenting spatial series, behavioral events, and analog signals such as accelerometer and gyroscope data.
- Detailed experiment logs including state script logs and task descriptions.
- Metadata regarding devices used, such as cameras, data acquisition devices, and probes.

This rich collection of data enables a comprehensive analysis of both electrophysiological signals and concurrent motor behaviors, facilitating investigations into the synchronization of neural and motor activities.
