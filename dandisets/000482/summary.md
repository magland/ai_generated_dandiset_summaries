# State-dependent Processing in Visual Cortex

This study aims to investigate the state-dependent processing mechanisms within the visual cortex of rabbits. Extracellular recordings from neurons in the visual cortex were collected during orientation testing using drifting grating stimuli. To assess different states, hippocampal EEG recordings were conducted concurrently for state scoring purposes. Orientation selectivity and crosscorrelation were likely examined to understand how visual information is processed under different neural states, possibly reflecting varying levels of attention or arousal.

The data available in the NWB files include detailed electrophysiological recordings. Specifically, the acquisition section captures stimuli information through time series data. Metadata associated with the electrodes, such as their grouping, labeling, and brain region locations, are documented comprehensively. The processing module, focusing on electrophysiological data, includes LFP and EEG recordings, primarily from the hippocampal region, which were filtered and analyzed using spike sorting techniques.

Additionally, the NWB files consist of units data that encapsulate spike times for each detected unit. The metadata further includes session-specific information such as session ID, session start time, and timestamps reference time. Institutional and researcher details, along with experimental keywords, are also provided.
