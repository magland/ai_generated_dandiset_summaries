## Abstract

The dataset encompasses extracellular electrophysiological recordings analyzed through the SpikeInterface framework, which unifies various spike sorting workflows. The featured research, "SpikeInterface, a unified framework for spike sorting," aims to standardize and enhance the accessibility of electrophysiological data analysis. Data were collected from house mice using multi-electrode arrays, enabling the detailed investigation of neuronal activity through advanced spike sorting techniques.

Four subjects were involved in the experiment, and the data were processed using state-of-the-art algorithms to isolate and classify neuronal spikes. The dataset, compliant with the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) standard, supports a broad array of electrophysiological studies and contributes to the reproducibility and comparability of spike sorting results across different laboratories.

## NWB Data Description

The NWB files include detailed metadata and recordings from multi-electrode extracellular electrophysiology experiments. Each file contains information such as electrode positions (x, y, z coordinates), channel impedance, and electrical series data. Additionally, spike times for individual neurons are documented, including the index for these spike times. The files also store descriptions of the hardware filtering applied, electrode group memberships, and timestamps reference times. There are three primary types of NWB files, with variations in the number of electrodes and session details specific to each type.
