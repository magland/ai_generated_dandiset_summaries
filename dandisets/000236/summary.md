### Thermoregulatory Responses in the Midbrain of Larval Zebrafish

This experiment investigates thermoregulatory responses in the midbrain of larval zebrafish using two-photon microscopy. The study focuses on nacre mutant (nac -/-) zebrafish expressing Elavl3-H2B:GCaMP6s and vglut2a-mCherry transgenes. The imaging was performed while the zebrafish were subjected to a random wave temperature stimulus protocol designed to elicit neural activity. The purpose of this experiment is likely to understand how zebrafish midbrain neurons respond to temperature changes, which could provide insights into the neural mechanisms underlying thermoregulation and sensory processing.

The experimental design includes a stimulus presentation consisting of 60 seconds of pre-stimulation, 30 seconds of temperature stimulation, and 75 seconds of post-stimulation, repeated three times. Temperature stimuli were presented as random waves with specific frequency parameters, and neural activity was recorded across 30 Z-planes at 5 Âµm spacings using a two-photon microscope. The data set provides a comprehensive view of neural responses to thermal stimuli in different layers of the zebrafish midbrain.

### Available Data in the NWB Files

The NWB files contain several types of data, including TwoPhotonSeries time series for each imaging plane and channel, detailed imaging plane information, and device metadata. The files also include behavioral data, such as cumulative tail angle and raw tail behavior data, which are associated with various Z-planes. Calcium imaging data processed using CaImAn, including inferred calcium signals (RoiResponseSeries), Dff (DfOverF), and image segmentation (PlaneSegmentation) for different planes, is also available. Temperature stimulus presentation data for all planes is included, providing a full account of the stimuli used during the experiment.
