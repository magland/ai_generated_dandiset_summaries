### Abstract

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of high-frequency (2 kHz) sine wave electrical stimulation on individual hippocampal neurons. Specifically, the investigations focused on how varying electric field amplitudes impact neuron action potentials. The electrical stimulation protocol involved gradually increasing the sine wave amplitude over the initial 0.25 seconds, then maintaining it at a constant voltage for a duration of 2 seconds, with the stimulation beginning at 25 milliseconds. Action potentials in neurons were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye FluoVolt, enabling optical recording of transmembrane potential changes.

The experiments were conducted in a controlled laboratory setting using fluorescence microscopy to capture action potentials at a high frame rate of 3134.8 frames per second. The neuronal activity was recorded under varying sine wave amplitudes, translating the applied voltages into electric fields of different intensities. The high-resolution data collected from these experiments can shed light on the bioelectrical properties of hippocampal neurons under electrical stimulation, potentially contributing to understanding therapeutic and research applications involving electric fields.

### Data Description

The dataset contains 17 NWB files, all capturing data from high-frequency sine wave stimulation experiments on hippocampal neurons. The files include metadata such as the session ID, date of creation, and experiment-related details. The primary measurements recorded consist of time-lapse fluorescence microscopy images where neurons loaded with FluoVolt were imaged to capture transmembrane potential changes. Each image series consists of 16x16 pixel frames recorded at 3134.8 frames per second, providing high temporal resolution insights into neuronal activity under the influence of 2 kHz sinusoidal electrical stimulation. Additional metadata includes specifics on the low-conductance physiological solution used during the experiments.
