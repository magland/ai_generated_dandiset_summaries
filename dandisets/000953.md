# Dandiset: FALCON Benchmark M2: Primary Motor Cortex Recordings in Primate During Finger Movement

## Overview

This dataset, part of the FALCON Benchmark, contains neural and behavioral data from a macaque performing a finger movement task. The task required the animal to move two groups of fingers in response to targets displayed on a screen. Neural recordings were obtained from arrays implanted in the primary motor cortex (M1), while finger positions were tracked using a manipulandum, with values normalized between full flexion and full extension.

The dataset includes multiunit spike times, 2D finger kinematics, and metadata useful for evaluating decoder performance in the FALCON challenge. Three distinct datasets are provided for calibration, validation, and few-shot recalibration tasks within the challenge. The data are split by session, with each session considered a separate "subject" in the DANDI repository.

## Data Summary

- **Species**: Rhesus monkey (*Macaca mulatta*)
- **Approaches**: Electrophysiology, behavioral
- **Techniques**: Spike sorting, behavioral tracking, surgical implantation
- **Data format**: Neurodata Without Borders (NWB)
- **Total size**: 22.4 MB
- **Number of files**: 20
- **Number of subjects**: 3 (each session treated as a separate subject)

## Key Data Available

1. **Behavioral Data**:
   - Finger movement data captured by the manipulandum. Finger positions (`finger_pos`) and velocities (`finger_vel`) are provided as behavioral time series data, recorded in 20ms bins.

2. **Neural Data**:
   - Neural activity recorded from a 2x64 channel Blackrock Utah array (96 active channels). Spiking activity from individual units is available, along with electrode metadata, including positions, impedance, and filtering details.
   - Spike times for 96 units are provided, alongside the electrode each unit was recorded from.

3. **Experimental Trials**:
   - The dataset includes 337 trials, with timestamps for trial start and stop times, target locations, and trial numbers. This allows for a detailed breakdown of task performance and corresponding neural activity.

## Experimental Setup

- **Electrode Array**: Neural data were captured using a 2x64-channel array implanted in the hand area of M1. 96 channels were active during the recordings, and detailed metadata about each electrode's location and impedance are provided.
- **Task Description**: The macaque performed a two-finger movement task in response to visual cues, with behavior sampled every 20ms. Some trials may include neural data at the end due to partial observation intervals.
- **Session Information**: Data were recorded on October 19, 2020. Each session includes a full description of the experimental setup, trial data, and neural recordings.

## Applications

This dataset is primarily intended for benchmarking decoding algorithms as part of the FALCON challenge. The neural and behavioral data can be used for:
- Decoding motor intentions from neural activity.
- Evaluating the performance of spike sorting algorithms.
- Modeling the relationship between neural activity in M1 and finger movements.

Given the detailed metadata and rich neural/behavioral data, this dataset can also be reused for broader studies on motor cortex function, spike sorting validation, or behavioral analysis in non-human primates.
