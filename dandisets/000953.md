# Dandiset 000953: FALCON Benchmark M2: Primary Motor Cortex Recordings in Primate During Finger Movement

## General Overview
This Dandiset contains multimodal datasets involving neural recordings and behavioral data from a macaque engaged in a finger movement task. Contributors to this dataset include Samuel R Nason-Tomaszewski, Matthew J. Mender, and Cynthia Chestek, with data curation by Joel Ye. The primary focus is on multiunit spiking times captured from the primary motor cortex (M1) using electrode arrays, alongside detailed kinematic data of finger movements. The task involved moving two finger groups in response to visually cued targets, with data collected to facilitate the development and testing of neural decoders for the FALCON benchmark.

## Contents of the NWB Files
The dataset is organized into 20 NWB files, each following a consistent format. These files contain comprehensive electrophysiological and behavioral data. Here's an overview of the representative data structure and contents of these files:

### Primary Data Groups and Their Contents
- **/acquisition**:
  - **/acquisition/eval_mask (TimeSeries)**: Specifies timesteps used for keeping covariates, critical for training and evaluation within the FALCON benchmark.
  - **/acquisition/finger_pos (BehavioralTimeSeries)**: Captures the position of the fingers, with indices and minimum response speeds also detailed.
  - **/acquisition/finger_vel (BehavioralTimeSeries)**: Documents the velocity of finger movements, with related indices and minimum response speeds.

- **/general**:
  - **/general/devices/Blackrock Utah Array (Device)**: Details on the 2x64-channel electrode array, with 96 channels actively recording.
  - **/general/extracellular_ephys/M1_array (ElectrodeGroup)**: Information on the electrode array positioned in the hand area of the M1 cortex, recording neural activity from 96 active channels.
  - **/general/extracellular_ephys/electrodes (DynamicTable)**: Provides metadata on each of the extracellular electrodes, including location, impedance, and filtering details.

- **/intervals/trials (TimeIntervals)**: Contains detailed timing and metadata for experimental trials, including start and stop times, trial numbers, and target locations.

- **/units (Units)**: Includes data on neural spike units, with reference to electrodes, spike times, and observation intervals for each unit, providing a granular view of neural activity during the experiment.

### Metadata and Institutional Information
- **Contributors**: Includes roles and identifiers for each contributor involved in the dataset.
- **Institution**: University of Michigan.
- **Lab**: Chestek Lab.
- **Session Information**: The session captured on 2020-10-19 includes trial and observation details and is identified as "MonkeyN_10-19-13:00_held_in" in the NWB files.

## Utilization Note
This Dandiset, while primarily aimed at supporting the FALCON benchmark, offers valuable insights and data for broader applications in neuroscience research, particularly in neural decoding and motor control studies.
