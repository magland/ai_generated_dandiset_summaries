### Abstract

The purpose of this study was to generate and analyze synthetic data reflecting the intrinsic variability of motor unit (MU) waveforms during rat locomotion. Using the MUsim repository, waveforms from 10 motor units were mimicked with up to 200 signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), under conditions of low background noise. However, the waveform shapes exhibited inherent variability, simulated at a 4 STD level based on the Kilosort spatial template matrix. The motor unit activities were recorded from a rat on a treadmill, providing insightful data on neuromuscular function and aiding in the refinement of electrophysiological analysis techniques.

### Data Description

The available data is encapsulated in one NWB file that contains comprehensive metadata and acquisition traces for an 8-channel bipolar EMG recording, performed with 4 separate threads. The data includes the electrical series and relevant dynamic table regions for electrodes, devices used (including the Myomatrix RF400 ecephys probe and the Open Ephys electrophysiology acquisition system), and metadata descriptions of electrophysiological electrodes. The included dataset details the channels, their locations, and references to respective electrode groups. The session identifier and description indicate that the data set corresponds to simulated activity with shape noise at 4 STD, correlating with a rat's locomotion on a treadmill.
