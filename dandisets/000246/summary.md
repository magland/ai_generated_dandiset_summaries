## Abstract

The dataset "developing CaMPARI3" is intended to advance the development of CaMPARI3, a photoconvertible calcium indicator. The study includes both in vivo and in vitro data collected from house mice (Mus musculus). Using sophisticated two-photon microscopy and various analytical techniques, the researchers aim to enhance our understanding of CaMPARI3's performance. Key experiments focused on measuring fluorescence changes under different conditions to optimize the indicator for broader applications in neurophysiological studies.

In vitro components of the study involved extensive screening of purified protein to determine key fluorescence characteristics, such as delta F/F and delta R/R. In vivo experiments involved optical imaging and photoconversion within the visual cortex of live mice. The combination of these methodologies aims to refine the functional properties of CaMPARI3, thereby contributing valuable insights that could facilitate its application in more complex neural circuits and behavior studies.

## NWB File Contents

### Type 1 NWB Files
The Type 1 NWB files include data from in vitro fluorescence recordings of purified CaMPARI3 protein. The primary dataset, stored as a TimeSeries, comprises screening results noted as changes in fluorescence (delta F/F) and their corresponding standard deviations. Additional parameters include raw and normalized fluorescence mean values (F) and their deviations, as well as changes in the red to green fluorescence ratio (delta R/R). Metadata such as the session description and experimenter information is also included.

### Type 2 NWB Files
Type 2 NWB files consist of in vivo two-photon imaging data from mouse brain experiments. These files contain detailed data structures capturing multiple aspects of optical physiology. The TwoPhotonSeries records frames across different depths and channels, and the processing modules contain fluorescence data, ROI response series, and image segmentation details. ImageSegmentation datasets identify segmented cells within the visual cortex and provide image masks. The metadata includes session descriptions, optical channel information, and identifiers for the subjects and imaging devices.
