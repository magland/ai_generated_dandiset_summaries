## Abstract

This study investigates the modulation of neural pathways in anesthetized rats using transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS). Neuronal activities were recorded from cortical-thalamocortical (CTC) pathways, specifically targeting the somatosensory cortex (S1), motor cortex (M1), and the posteromedial complex (PoM) of the thalamus. Additionally, the neural responses of the auditory cortex (AC) were evaluated when tFUS was targeted at S1. The experiments deployed a 128-element transducer to deliver tFUS at varying pulse repetition frequencies (PRFs) and pulse durations (PDs), systematically evaluating how these parameters influence neural activity.

Recordings were conducted using 32-channel Neuronexus electrodes with stimulation events occurring every 2.5 seconds across 500 trials per session. The ultrasound duration was maintained at 67ms with a consistent pressure of approximately 90 kPa. The primary goal is to explore how different PRFs and PDs modulate neuronal spike timing and cross-area spike time tiling coefficient (STTC), thereby enhancing the understanding of tFUS-induced neural modulation within and across different brain regions.

## Data Description

The dataset comprises 100 NWB (Neurodata Without Borders) files, categorized into two main types. Type 1 files contain detailed information on neural spikes in the context of tFUS for neural pathways targeting the motor cortex (M1). The contents include device metadata, electrode configuration, trial intervals, and spike times data. Additionally, the files provide spike sorting data, including cell type labels, spike times, and indexed spike times for units recorded.

Type 2 files similarly document neural spike activity but are specifically associated with tFUS stimulation targeting the somatosensory cortex (S1). These files also contain metadata on the devices used, electrode details, trial information, and spike times data. Both types of NWB files include extensive metadata on the experimental setup, such as session start times, trial timestamps, and electrode properties.
