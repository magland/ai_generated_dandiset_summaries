# Abstract

The experiment detailed in this dataset investigates the dynamics of plasma membrane (PM) polarization in hippocampal neurons when exposed to brief, 2 Âµs electric field pulses. The primary objective is to explore how the shape and alignment of neurons influence their polarization kinetics, utilizing the voltage-sensitive FluoVolt dye to visualize these processes. Pulsed laser strobe microscopy was the key technique employed, allowing for visualization of rapid transmembrane potential (TMP) changes with high temporal resolution. Data was gathered under a variety of voltage amplitudes and time intervals, aiming to elucidate the biophysical processes governing neuronal polarization in complex electric fields. This study was partially funded by the NIH Brain Initiative (NEI R21EY034803).

A major focus of the study is the interplay between neuronal morphology and its position relative to the electric field, which could have significant implications for understanding neural activation and safety in electrostimulation therapies. Methodologically, researchers employed a backward recording approach to prevent alterations in cell responses from repeated electrical stimulation. This comprehensive dataset provides a rich resource for understanding not only the immediate biophysical events following electric pulse applications but also the longer-term implications of high-speed ion dynamics in neural tissues.

# NWB File Data Description

The NWB files included in this dataset contain time-lapse strobe imaging data, capturing rapid changes in PM polarization at a frame rate of 6 Hz, despite the phenomena occurring at 40 MHz. Each session involves numerous frames detailing transient membrane potentials during electric pulse exposure, achieved using a pulsed laser coinciding with each activation sequence. The files include meticulously segmented image series, capturing step-wise changes with nanosecond precision. Additionally, each session describes the experimenter, the institution, and other relevant metadata, indicating the use of standard physiological solutions and specific experiment conditions, such as pulse amplitude and inter-electrode spacing.
