### Abstract

This experiment aimed to investigate neural activity through optogenetic stimulation in a VIP-Cre;Ai32 mouse. Specifically, the study involved the first recording session of a series conducted on a single day. Utilizing Neuropixels probes, the extracellular electrophysiology data was recorded, contributing to the understanding of how optogenetic stimuli influence neural firing patterns. The experiment was guided by a protocol designated as 2104 and was executed by the Neural Dynamics lab at the Allen Institute.

Per the data collection protocol, multiple Electrode Groups (ProbeA, ProbeC, ProbeE, ProbeF) were used to capture detailed spike times and waveforms. These recordings are instrumental in elucidating the impact of various conditions and levels of optogenetic stimulation on the observed neural dynamics. The session ID for this recording was 2021-02-09_546513_1, and Andrew Shelton, a contact person for this dataset, led the experimentation process.

### Data Description

The NWB file contains comprehensive metadata and datasets related to the extracellular electrophysiology of the experiment. Key groups include general metadata on the devices used (Neuropixels Probes) and electrode groups (Probes A, C, E, F), as well as descriptions of hardware filtering and electrode placement (x, y, z coordinates). The file also records the start and stop times for experimental trials, along with trial conditions and levels of optogenetic stimulation.

The datasets cover detailed spike times and waveform data for each unit, as well as per-unit calculations like the 10ms pulse PSTH and 1s cosine PSTH. Additional metadata includes electrode impedance, electrode group references, and locations of channels within the brain. The units section captures various attributes per unit, such as firing rate, inter-spike intervals (ISI), optotagging status, and genotypes. The file is structured to facilitate detailed analysis of spike timing and waveform properties across different experimental conditions.
