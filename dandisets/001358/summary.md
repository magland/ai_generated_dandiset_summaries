## Abstract

The current study investigates the neural mechanisms underlying visual crowding in macaque area V4, an essential part of the primate visual processing hierarchy known for its role in object recognition and visual attention. Utilizing extracellular electrophysiological recordings, the experiment analyzes the responses of 147 V4 neurons in two awake, fixating Rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). The primary focus is to explore how neural selectivity to a target shape is altered by the presence of surrounding clutter stimuli, thus providing insights into the perceptual phenomenon of crowdingâ€”a condition where the perception of an object is impaired by nearby flankers.

The study involves a systematic evaluation of neuronal activity in varying crowding conditions, characterized by different target and flanker configurations. By leveraging electrophysiological techniques and precise stimulus presentation, the experiment aims to delineate the extent to which crowding influences neural activity in area V4. The outcomes of this research are anticipated to enhance our understanding of visual processing in complex environments, contributing to a broader comprehension of attention and perceptual organization in the visual cortex.

## Data Description

The available Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files in this dataset comprise detailed electrode metadata, trial intervals, and precise spike times from V4 neurons in Rhesus monkeys. These files contain records from single tungsten electrodes capturing electrophysiological data under different crowding conditions. Each file documents metadata about the electrode, such as its group and location, along with trial-specific information like condition IDs, stimulus onset and offset times, and rotation angles of target shapes. The dataset also provides spike timing and indexing information for neuronal units during the recordings. In total, there are 100 well-structured NWB files capturing extensive details of the dynamics of V4 neurons under various experimental manipulations.
