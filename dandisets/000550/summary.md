## Experiment Abstract

This study investigates the effect of pulse repetition rate on the efficiency of electroporation using unipolar and bipolar pulses in cell samples. Utilizing a train of five 600 ns unipolar pulses or five 600+600 ns bipolar pulses, with the second phase's amplitude set at 50% of the first pulse's amplitude, the research aims to discern the impact of different pulse repetition rates—833 kHz, 500 kHz, 100 kHz, and 10 kHz—on cellular permeabilization. The electroporation setup employed two parallel stainless-steel cylindrical electrodes, each 1.5 mm in diameter and spaced 3 mm apart. The electrodes were designed to ensure uniform electric field distribution across the sample wells.

Fluorescent imaging techniques were utilized to visualize the electroporation outcomes. MemBrite dye labeled all cells, while the membrane-impermeable dye YOPRO-1 highlighted the permeabilized cells. The resulting images capture the footprint of the electrodes as dark circles, where no electroporation occurs. The overarching objective is to optimize pulse parameters for maximal electroporative efficiency, potentially contributing to enhanced delivery methods in clinical and laboratory settings. This study was supported by the National Institutes of Health under award number R21EY034258.
