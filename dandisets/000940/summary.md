## Hippocampal Theta Phase Precession Supports Memory Formation and Retrieval of Naturalistic Experience in Humans

The dataset investigates the role of hippocampal theta phase precession in memory formation and retrieval processes in humans. This was studied by analyzing single neuron activity and local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from patients with intractable epilepsy implanted with depth electrodes and Behnke-Fried microwires in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL). These patients performed a cognitive boundary task that involved encoding, recognition, and time discrimination trials with distinct boundary markers. The study explores how phase precession of theta oscillations in the hippocampus correlates with the cognitive processes related to naturalistic experience and memory tasks.

The likely purpose of the experiment was to comprehend the neuronal mechanisms underlying episodic memory, particularly the role of theta oscillations in supporting the encoding and retrieval of memory. By aligning neural activity with behavioral events during well-defined cognitive tasks, the dataset aims to reveal patterns that signify how temporal coding in the hippocampus might facilitate the segregation and retrieval of memory episodes. This contributes to a broader understanding of the fundamental principles of human memory and could potentially inform clinical interventions for memory-related disorders.

## Data Available in NWB Files

The Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files contain detailed electrophysiological data and behavioral annotations from 21 subjects. Each file includes downsampled LFP recordings at 250 Hz, spike times from single neurons, detailed descriptions of the electrodes used, and timestamps corresponding to specific behavioral events in the experiment. The data features classifications for different trial types (encoding, recognition, time discrimination) with TTL markers marking the start and end of each trial, stimulus presentation, and responses. Additionally, interval tables include specific timestamps for cognitive boundaries, such as hard boundaries (HB), soft boundaries (SB), and no boundaries (NB), along with details on reaction times, accuracy, and confidence levels.
