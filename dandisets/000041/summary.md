## Network Homeostasis and State Dynamics of Neocortical Sleep

This experiment was designed to study the network homeostasis and state dynamics during sleep in the neocortex of male Long Evans rats. The recordings were made using silicon probe electrodes implanted in the frontal cortices of rats aged between 4 to 7 months. A total of 11 rats were involved in this study, with 27 recording sessions capturing over 1360 units. The goal was to observe the electrical activities during natural behaviors without any imposed tasks or stimuli, focusing particularly on episodes that included at least 7 minutes of wakefulness followed by 20 minutes of sleep. Such "WAKE-SLEEP" episodes were repeatedly observed and analyzed within each recording session, providing rich data for understanding sleep state dynamics.

The study aimed to understand how states of arousal and sleep can influence neural activity and homeostasis in the brain's network. Data amassed from these experimental sessions provides valuable insights into excitatory and inhibitory neural interactions, and the electrophysiological characteristics of various neural states. It supports investigations into how sleep and wakefulness alternate and affect neural dynamics and stability in cortical networks.

## Data Available in the NWB Files

The NWB files included in this dataset provide comprehensive data on neural activities recorded during the experiments. The data comprises local field potentials (LFP) and spike information. The metadata section contains detailed information about the electrode specifications: electrode locations, impedances, and filtering techniques used. Each file captures extensive temporal data of spikes and intervals marking different sleep states.

Specific dataset sections within the files include:
- **Electrodes Table**: Detailed metadata of individual electrodes, including their coordinates, channel numbers, and specific reference purposes for calculating slow-wave sleep, theta canonical bands, and UP-states.
- **Behavior Module**: Time intervals categorizing different sleep states, including start and end times.
- **Electrophysiology Module**: Processed data, such as LFP signals and spike waveforms across different shanks (electrode groups).
- **Decomposition Series**: Frequency bands for spindle, theta, and UP states, including data on low and high-frequency filters.
