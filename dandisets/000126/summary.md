## Experiment Summary

The experiment detailed in Dandiset 000126, titled "NWB API Test Data," was conducted to validate and test the functionalities of the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) APIs, including PyNWB and MatNWB. The primary focus was to create and manipulate NWB files to ensure compatibility and correctness in reading and writing operations. This involved generating a series of NWB files containing specific data elements that could be used to test the API features.

The data used in this experiment consists of a test NWB file, which includes a TimeSeries dataset and Subject metadata. The intention was not to investigate a specific neuroscientific question but rather to ensure the robustness and reliability of the infrastructure provided by the NWB APIs.

## Data Description

The available data in the NWB file includes a single TimeSeries under the acquisition group labeled "TestData" and a Subject group containing general subject metadata. The subject is identified by the UUID 3f77c586-6139-4777-a05d-f603e90b1330. The session began on August 12, 2021, at 18:29:38 UTC, coinciding with the timestamp reference time. The file creation date is noted as the same date, reflecting when the test data file was generated for the experiment.
