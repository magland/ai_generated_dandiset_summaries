### Abstract

This study investigates the intrinsic activity within human brain organoid slices and aims to model the dynamic states present in developing human cortex. Utilizing human cortical organoids, the experiments focus on characterizing spontaneous electrophysiological activities through multi-electrode extracellular recordings. The primary goal of this research is to understand how these activities correlate with the intrinsic states observed in the developing human brain, potentially offering insights into neurodevelopmental processes and disorders.

To achieve this, recordings were performed on human brain organoid slices, alongside primary murine cortical cultures and acute neonatal murine somatosensory cortex slices. The data were meticulously gathered using advanced electrophysiological techniques, ensuring high-quality recordings of electrical activities. This multi-faceted approach allows for comprehensive cross-species analysis, providing a robust framework for understanding neuronal activity patterns relevant to human brain development.

### Data Description

The NWB files included in this dataset provide detailed electrophysiological data from the experiments. Specifically, the type 1 NWB files contain spike sorting data generated from human brain organoid slices, including metrics such as electrode numbers, spike times, unit IDs, and coordinates for maximum x and y positions. These files were created using kilosort2 output and include detailed metadata about the recording session and subject.

The type 2 NWB files consist of acquisition traces for electrical series, metadata about the extracellular electrodes, and detailed descriptions of the devices used. These files contain electrode-specific information such as channel names, electrode gains to microvolts, and relative positions of the electrodes on the recording array. This rich dataset provides a comprehensive view of the intrinsic electrophysiological activity in the human cortical organoids under study.
