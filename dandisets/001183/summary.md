## Experiment Summary

In this experiment, electrophysiological recordings from neurons in the medial preoptic area (MPOA) of *Mus musculus* (house mouse) were conducted under conditions of chronic restraint stress to investigate the neural circuits involved in the modulation of persistent negative emotional states by social factors. Chronic stress is known to induce significant changes in neural circuitry and behavior, often leading to negative emotional states. Understanding how social interactions modulate these stress-induced states could provide crucial insights into the neural underpinnings of social behaviors and affective disorders.

The primary aim of this research appears to be to characterize the electrophysiological properties of neurons in response to stress and to identify how social interactions could influence these properties. Chronic restraint stress was employed to model the persistent negative emotional state, while neuronal activity was meticulously recorded and analyzed. The study's findings could shed light on potential therapeutic targets for mitigating the adverse effects of chronic stress through social interventions.

## NWB Files Data Description

The NWB files contain comprehensive intracellular electrophysiological data recorded from neurons in the MPOA. Each file includes data groups and datasets that store metadata and detailed intracellular recordings. Key data components include the IZeroClampSeries, which captures the response to a long-square pulse stimulation, and an IntracellularElectrode detailing the recording electrode's properties. The files also consist of multiple metadata tables, such as the IntracellularRecordingsTable, for grouping stimuli and responses, the IntracellularResponsesTable, and the IntracellularStimuliTable, which provide extensive metadata for the recorded responses and stimuli, respectively.

Additionally, the NWB files contain SequentialRecordingsTable and SimultaneousRecordingsTable, allowing for the organization and referencing of sequential and simultaneous recordings across different electrodes. Each file is highly structured, enabling detailed analyses of the intracellular responses to chronic stress and the potential modulatory impact of social factors.
