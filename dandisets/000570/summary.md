## Experiment Summary

The data from Dandiset 000570, titled "20230630_AIBS_Patchseq_human," emanates from the Allen Institute for Brain Science under the project leadership of Ed Lein and the contribution of several researchers, supported by the National Institute of Mental Health. The experiment's purpose likely centers on the electrophysiological characterization of human neurons using Patch-seq, a method that combines patch-clamp electrophysiology, single-cell RNA sequencing, and morphological reconstruction. The data encompasses electrical recordings from 58 individual human subjects, culminating in insights into the physiological properties and responses of human neurons in voltage clamp and current clamp configurations, thereby facilitating an in-depth understanding of neuronal behavior.

The approach involves the utilization of the Harvard Bioscience ITC18USB device for intracellular recordings to measure voltage and current responses under various stimulus conditions. The electrophysiological data collected provides comprehensive information about the electrical properties of neurons, which will be invaluable for correlating electrophysiological characteristics with gene expression profiles obtained through single-cell RNA sequencing.

## Data Description

The NWB files contain detailed electrophysiological data collected from human neurons. Each file includes VoltageClampSeries and CurrentClampSeries data, acquired using intracellular electrodes connected to the Harvard Bioscience ITC18USB device.
