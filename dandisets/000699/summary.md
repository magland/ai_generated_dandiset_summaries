## Abstract

This study investigates the swimming behavior of zebrafish (_Danio rerio_) at a constant environmental temperature of 20Â°C, aiming to elucidate temperature preference behavior through a controlled setting. Conducted at THE Ohio State University, the experiment placed zebrafish within a gradient environmental chamber, commonly used to analyze behavioral responses across varying spatial conditions. The primary focus was to observe and analyze the behavioral patterns of fish in relation to temperature constancy and illumination, contributing to understanding of thermal niche preferences in controlled laboratory conditions. Each subject was observed in two separate lanes within the chamber, ensuring a balanced assessment of behavioral metrics.

The apparatus employed was engineered to maintain precise temperature control and record high-resolution data at a frame rate of 100 Hz. This facilitated the accurate capture of spatial positioning and directional headings of the zebrafish, including parameters such as fish heading in radians and their position coordinates within the chamber. The experiment was meticulously planned to accommodate one specimen at a time over a 30-minute duration, yielding comprehensive behavioral datasets. The findings of this research could serve as a baseline for understanding zebrafish behavior in response to constant thermal environments and may inform further studies focused on temperature-induced behavioral adaptations.

## Data Description

The 17 NWB files available within this Dandiset contain detailed behavioral data for each of the zebrafish subjects tested. Essential data collected include the absolute heading direction of the fish in both left and right lanes of the gradient chamber. Positional data features the fish's location within the swimming lanes in millimeter coordinates, while temperature data log the precise temperature at the fish's position throughout the session. Additionally, unique identifiers and session-specific metadata, such as start time and experimental parameters, are included to ensure seamless interpretation of the recorded data. The processing modules catalog additional behavioral metrics, such as fish heading and chamber position, supplemented by a detailed temperature time series of each fish's ambient environment.
