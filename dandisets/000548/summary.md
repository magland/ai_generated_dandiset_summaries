## Effect of the Number of Pulses on Electroporation by Unipolar and 50% Bipolar Pulses

This study investigates the impact of varying the number of electric pulses on cell electroporation efficacy using unipolar and 50% bipolar pulse protocols. Cells were subjected to trains of 5, 10, or 15 pulses at 1 Hz, utilizing either unipolar 600 ns pulses or bipolar 600+600 ns pulses, where the second pulse's amplitude was reduced to 50% of the first. The aim was to discern the effects of pulse number and polarity on membrane permeabilization, providing insights into optimizing protocols for electroporation applications.

Experimental procedures involved using stainless-steel cylindrical electrodes to deliver the electric pulses. After electroporation, cells were labeled with membrane-impermeable fluorescence dye YOPRO-1 to visualize permeabilization and with MemBrite dye for cell membrane labeling. Images were captured across a grid in a six-well plate and stitched to form composite representations of the results. Data collection was supported by NIH grant R21EY034258, with experiments conducted at Old Dominion University's Pakhomov Lab.

### Data Available in NWB Files

The NWB files contain detailed imaging data from the electroporation experiments. Each file documents images from specific sessions where different pulse count protocols were applied:
- **Channel 1 images:** Ex/em 350/460nm and ex/em 480/535nm, showing MemBrite dye and YOPRO-1 staining.
- **Composite images:** Generated from 144 smaller images (12x12 grid) stitched together.
- **Session details:** Metadata such as experimenter names, institution, session description, and unique session identifiers.
