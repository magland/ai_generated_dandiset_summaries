## Experiment Summary

This dataset contains neural activity recordings from a tetraplegic human participant executing a brain-computer interface (BCI) finger press task. Neural signals were captured from a 96-channel Utah array implanted in the left posterior parietal cortex (PPC) at the junction of the postcentral and intraparietal sulci (PC-IP). During each trial, a pseudorandomly located finger cue was displayed on a screen, prompting the participant to look at the cue and attempt to press the indicated finger. Feedback from the decoder was provided 1.5 seconds post-cue.

The purpose of this experiment is likely to investigate the neural encoding of finger movements within the human PPC and to assess the efficacy of BCI systems in interpreting intention from neural activity in a tetraplegic individual. By collecting both neural activity and behavioral data during targeted finger movements, the study aims to enhance understanding of motor control and improve the development of neuroprosthetic devices.

## Available Data in NWB Files
