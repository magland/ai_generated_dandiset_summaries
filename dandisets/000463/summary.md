## Electrophysiological Recordings in Anesthetized Rats in the Primary Somatosensory Cortex with Phased Ultrasound Array Stimulation

In this study, electrophysiological experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of phased ultrasound array stimulation on the primary somatosensory cortex of anesthetized rats. The subjects, which were rats anesthetized with 2% isoflurane via inhalation, were exposed to varying intensities and pulse repetition frequencies (PRFs) of ultrasound stimulation. The cortical responses to these stimulations were recorded using 32-channel Neuronexus electrodes. Ultrasound pulses were delivered every 2.5 seconds over recording sessions consisting of either 200 or 500 trials each.

The purpose of these experiments was likely to understand the neural mechanisms underlying sensory processing and modulation via ultrasound, which could have implications for developing novel neurotherapeutic techniques. By systematically varying the parameters of ultrasound stimulation and monitoring electrophysiological responses, the study aimed to elucidate the potential for precise control of neural activity using non-invasive methods.

### Available Data in NWB Files

The Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files contain a comprehensive dataset that includes various aspects of the experimental setup and recordings. Key data elements include:

- **Electrophysiological data**: Raw extracellular recordings captured in ElectricalSeries, specifically targeting neural activity across 32 electrodes.
- **Electrode Information**: Detailed metadata about the electrodes, including their grouping, locations (x, y, z coordinates), impedance, filtering parameters, and group names.
- **Device Specifications**: Information on the recording devices, specifically the A1x32-Poly3-10mm-50-177-A32 electrode array used.
- **Session Metadata**: General information such as session descriptions, start times, timestamps reference time, and subject identifiers.
- **Processing Modules**: Data processing details including the local field potential (LFP) information stored under the processing module "ecephys".
