## Abstract

The experiment investigates the nonradiative photothermal (PT) and photoacoustic (PA) processes, which are pivotal in applications involving imaging, stimulation, and therapy. The primary goal is to elucidate the interaction of these fields with biological systems by mapping the generation and propagation of PT and PA waves. A novel approach, spatial offset pump-probe imaging (SOPPI), is introduced to achieve this. By strategically offsetting the pump and probe beams, SOPPI facilitates simultaneous imaging of PA and PT wave propagation with high temporal and spatial resolutions. This method boasts a 65 MHz detection bandwidth and remarkable sensitivity of 9.9 Pa noise equivalent pressure. The study provides insights into the PA and PT evolution from a fiber emitter, which could significantly enhance the efficacy of photoacoustic neuromodulation, particularly in retinal applications.

The mapping revealed by SOPPI could potentially revolutionize how PA fields are understood and manipulated in biomedical contexts. By providing a clearer picture of wave evolution and interaction, this research offers a foundational understanding necessary for advancing PA-based neuromodulation techniques. Such insights could inform future therapeutic strategies, especially for retinal neuromodulation, by clarifying the dynamic behaviors of PA waves within biological tissues.

## NWB File Data Description

There are currently no NWB files available in the Dandiset 001364. As such, there is no NWB file data to describe. The exploration and analysis of photoacoustic and photothermal processes highlighted in this experiment are likely supported by data that would typically include temporal and spatial wave propagation measurements and related experimental parameters if the files were present.
