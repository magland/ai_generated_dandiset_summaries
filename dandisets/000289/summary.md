## Abstract

The study investigates the neural encoding and learning mechanisms in the central complex of Drosophila melanogaster, focusing on how flies process and adapt to sensory cues of varying reliability. Two-photon calcium imaging was employed to measure the activity of ellipsoid body-protocerebral bridge (EPG) neurons in response to visual stimuli with controlled variability. The experiment aimed to elucidate the relationships between sensory reliability, neural representation, and behavioral outcomes, contributing to the understanding of uncertainty processing in a neural ring attractor model.

This research provides a detailed analysis of how fruit flies adjust their behavior and neural activity in response to changes in visual cue reliability. By systematically varying the contrast, gain, and presentation mode of visual stimuli, and recording continuous calcium signals from EPG cells, the study seeks to map the neural correlates of sensory-driven learning and uncertainty management in a compact and genetically tractable model organism.

## Available Data in NWB Files

The NWB files encompass multiple data types including calcium imaging data, behavioral metrics, and trial-specific information. Two-photon series data captures the DF/F signals of identified regions of interest (ROIs) within the brain's protocerebral bridge midline. Behavioral data track the positional compass direction of the subjects during stimuli presentation. Each file contains specific trial details such as start and stop times, and varying properties like cue gain or contrast. Additionally, the files document the imaging and optical setup, including details about devices and optical channels.
