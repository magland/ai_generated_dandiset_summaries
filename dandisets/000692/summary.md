# Whole-brain spontaneous GCaMP activity with NeuroPAL cell ID information of semi-restricted worms

## Scientific Abstract

In this study, we investigated the spontaneous neuronal activities in the brain of the nematode *Caenorhabditis elegans*. Utilizing GCaMP and tagRFP imaging, we captured the neuronal dynamics covering nearly all neurons in the nematode brain. The worms were semi-restricted in a microfluidic device, facilitating the stable imaging of their neural activity. We employed 3DeeCellTracker for cell segmentation and tracking, and leveraged NeuroPAL signals along with the NeuroPAL Auto-ID software for accurate neuronal identity information, supplemented with manual corrections where necessary. These efforts collectively aim to provide a comprehensive map of spontaneous neuronal activity corresponding to identified neurons under semi-restricted conditions.

The high-resolution imaging utilized a Nikon Eclipse Ti-U Inverted Microscope with a Yokogawa CSU-X1 SoRA spinning disk confocal scanner, ensuring precise data collection. This data is critical for understanding the baseline neural activity in *C. elegans* and can serve as a reference for further studies involving neural manipulations or behavioral assays. The dataset also highlights some occasional transient failures in neuronal tracking, suggesting the use of a moving median filter to mitigate these issues in subsequent data analysis.
