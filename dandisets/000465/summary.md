## Human brain mapping with multithousand-channel PtNRGrids resolves spatiotemporal dynamics

In this dataset, high-spatial resolution electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings were obtained using PtNRGrids. These are advanced recording devices featuring a square-shaped array with 1024 channels at a 150-Âµm pitch. The primary aim was to record neural activity from the entire right primary somatosensory barrel cortex in response to sensory stimuli. The sensory responses were elicited by delivering targeted air puffs to individual whiskers on the contralateral side via a microcapillary tube. The data resulting from this experiment underscore the PtNRGrids' capability to capture functional cortical columns at sub-mm resolution from the brain surface.

This experimental framework allowed for the precise mapping of the cortical response to sensory stimuli at a fine-grained spatial resolution, contributing important insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of neural activities in the somatosensory cortex. The high-density, multichannel recordings provide a rich dataset for the study of sensory processing and the organization of cortical columns.

## Data Available in the NWB Files

The dataset includes 36 NWB files from 4 subjects, featuring recordings through a 512-channel or 1024-channel Intan Recording Controller (part numbers C3004 or C3008). Key datasets include voltage data recorded from the amplifiers and auxiliary inputs of Intan Technologies chips. Additional recorded data comprises supply voltage, analog input, and metadata about the extracellular electrodes. Each file documents detailed electrode information, such as impedance, phase, location within the brain, custom and native channel names, and x, y, z coordinates. Four types of electrode groups are described: Intan Ports A to H, along with specifications on hardware filtering. 

Data fields covering device-specific information and electrode metadata, along with linked references to electrode groups, are standardized across the dataset. This configuration provides researchers with comprehensive metadata necessary for precise replicability and analysis of the recorded neural activities.
