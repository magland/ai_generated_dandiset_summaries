## Experiment Summary

The experiment involved whole-cell Patch-seq recordings from human neurons sourced from the neocortex, conducted by researchers at the Allen Institute for Brain Science during June 2021. The objective likely centers on understanding the electrophysiological properties of these neurons under various stimulation protocols, enabling detailed profiling of their functional characteristics and helping to elucidate fundamental aspects of human cortical physiology. These insights can offer a deeper understanding of both normal brain functions and the underlying mechanisms of various neurological conditions.

The experiment included recordings from neurons belonging to several human subjects, with each neuron exposed to a set of predefined electrical stimuli. By combining intricate patch-clamp techniques with sequencing (Patch-seq), the recordings are likely aimed at correlating the electrical behavior with the underlying molecular and genetic profiles of the neurons. This dual approach serves to provide a comprehensive data set that can be invaluable for constructing detailed models of neuron function and variability.
