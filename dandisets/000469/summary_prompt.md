Below is an auto-generated summary of the contents of a Dandiset. It includes both metadata and a summary of the contents of the NWB files.

Please summarize the experiment in two or three paragraphs in the style of a scientific abstract touching on the likely purpose of the experiment.

Then give a description of what data are available in the NWB files.

Finally provide a list of up to ten keywords.

You should not refer to "Type X" since these are just internal labels used for communicating the breakdown of NWB files.

The summaries are from representative NWB files for each type, so keep that in mind when making your description. So for example, the timestamp or session ID is not going to be representative of all NWB files of that type.

Please provide your response in raw markdown suitable for copy/paste into a .md document.

description: We present a dataset of 1809 single neurons recorded from the human medial temporal lobe (amygdala and hippocampus) and medial frontal lobe (anterior cingulate cortex, pre-supplementary motor area, ventral medial prefrontal cortex) across 41 sessions from 21 patients that underwent intracranial monitoring for epileptic activity. Subjects first performed a screening task (907 neurons), based on which we identified images for which highly selective cells were present in the medial temporal lobe. Subjects then performed a working memory task (902 neurons), in which they were sequentially presented with 1-3 images, and following a maintenance period, were asked if a probe was identical to one of the currently maintained images. This Neural data without borders (NWB) formatted dataset includes spike times, extracellular spike waveforms, stimuli presented, behavior, electrode locations, and subject demographics. As validation, we replicate previous findings on the existence of concept cells and their persistent activity during working memory maintenance. This dataset provides a substantial amount of rare human single neuron recordings together with behavior, thereby enabling investigation of the neural mechanisms of working memory at the single-neuron level.
