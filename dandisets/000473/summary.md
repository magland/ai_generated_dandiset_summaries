### Scientific Abstract

The study investigates the role of Esr1+ hypothalamic-habenula neurons in shaping aversive states by performing high-density extracellular recordings in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of head-fixed mice during an aversive conditioning task. Utilizing Neuropixels probes, neuronal responses to both internally generated and externally derived aversive signals were recorded. This involved optogenetic activation of specific neural pathways and applying aversive stimuli such as air puffs to probe neuronal dynamics in real-time.

The data aims to decipher neural circuitry mechanisms that underpin aversive state modulation, with a particular focus on how Esr1+ neurons influence prefrontal cortical networks. The experiment also incorporates a multi-faceted approach, combining optogenetics, electrophysiology, behavioral assays, and analytical techniques, to provide a comprehensive view of the neuronal circuits involved in processing aversive stimuli.

### Data Description in NWB Files

The available NWB files contain extensive data recorded during the experiments. Each file includes detailed information such as timestamps, session IDs, and device descriptions (Neuropixels probes and laser devices). Specific datasets include electrode positioning, spike times, LFP (Local Field Potentials), and optogenetic stimulation details. Behavioral data, such as pupil tracking and face motion traces, are also available. The trial data encompasses various parameters like air puff amplitude and duration, optogenetic pulse details, sound frequency, and amplitude.

Moreover, the NWB files store comprehensive metadata such as experiment descriptions, session details, surgical procedures, and identified units' characteristics (e.g., spike sorting, waveform means).
