# Reach-related Single Unit Activity in the Parkinsonian Macaque

This dataset investigates the impact of Parkinsonism on reach-related neuronal activity in macaque monkeys. By administering MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) to two subjects, the researchers induce Parkinsonism, with recordings conducted before and after the MPTP treatment. The specific focus includes single-unit recordings from multiple brain areas, notably the globus pallidus internus (GPi), ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus (VLa, VLp), primary motor cortex (M1), supplementary motor area (SMA), external globus pallidus (GPe), the thalamic reticular nucleus (RTN), striatum (STR), and the intermediate region between RTN and VL thalamus (R-V). These recordings are part of a choice reaction time reaching task, enabling the exploration of how Parkinsonism affects neuronal activity during controlled movements.

Neuronal activity was recorded using 16-contact linear probes and glass-insulated tungsten microelectrodes, with amplifications and digitizations processed at high resolutions. The data were high-pass filtered and analyzed using principal components space clustering for spike sorting. This comprehensive approach provides valuable insights into the neurological responses in Parkinsonian states, contributing to a better understanding of the disease's impact on motor function.

## Available Data in NWB Files

The NWB files contain detailed extracellular electrophysiological data. Specific data available includes:
- **Acquisition Data**: Raw electrical traces, high-pass filtered traces (200 Hz).
- **Electrode Metadata**: Informations about electrode positioning and types, including device and channel IDs.
- **Trial Data**: Details on the timing of various events during the experimental trials, such as cue onset, movement start, and reward times.
- **Spike Sorting Data**: Spike times and units identified through Plexon Offline Sorter v3, indicating brain regions and quality of sorting.
- **Subject Information**: Metadata about the individual macaques, such as identifiers and pharmacological details.

Such extensive and detailed data enables robust analyses of neuronal activity and how it correlates with Parkinsonian symptoms and reach-related tasks.
