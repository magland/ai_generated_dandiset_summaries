# Cortical Circuits for the Integration of Short-Latency Auditory Pathways: MGN Linear Probe Recording

This study aims to explore the functional integration of short-latency auditory pathways within the cortical circuits, focusing on the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN) of the mouse brain. The research utilizes a high-density, linear probe recording approach to capture the electrophysiological response of MGN neurons following click sound presentations. By capturing unit activity data from multiple sessions across different subjects, the experiment seeks to elucidate the role of MGN in processing auditory information in real-time. This work contributes to the broader understanding of how early auditory signals are integrated in the brain, potentially influencing auditory perception and related behavioral outcomes.

Employing an electrophysiological approach, the experiment captures spike sorting data for individual units, detailing spike times, electrode references, and mean waveforms. An Open-Ephys 64-channel Cambridge probe was used for the recordings, with histological imaging paths confirming probe placements. The resulting dataset includes detailed temporal intervals corresponding to click trials, allowing for precise correlation between auditory stimuli and neuronal responses. The study involves 26 subjects, each contributing to an extensive dataset aimed at refining our comprehension of cortico-thalamic interactions.

## Available Data in NWB Files

The NWB files contain rich, structured data on neuronal activity recorded from the mouse MGN. Data includes electrode group positions, spike times, and classified unit activities indicative of single or multi-unit activity. Each file also comprises temporal markers denoting trial start and stop times across 200 click presentations per session. Additionally, histological images showing probe trajectories are archived, validating recording sites. The NWB files serve as a comprehensive resource for neuroscientific investigations of auditory processing within the MGN and its broader cortical integrations.
