## Neural Population Dynamics during Reaching

In this experiment, neural activity was recorded from both the motor cortex (M1) and the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) of rhesus monkeys while they performed reaching tasks. High-density Utah arrays, each with 96 channels, were implanted in the monkeys to capture detailed electrophysiological data. Through various task conditions, including different positions and numbers of targets and barriers, the objective was likely to investigate neural population dynamics during the planning and execution of motor actions. This research provides valuable insights into how different regions of the brain coordinate during complex motor tasks and could have implications for neuroprosthetics and the understanding of motor control in primates.

Behavioral and spike sorting techniques were employed to monitor both neural signals and behavioral data such as hand position and eye movements. The combination of electrophysiological and behavioral data enables comprehensive analysis of how neural circuits in M1 and PMd contribute to motor planning and execution. This information could be critical in decoding motor intentions and refining brain-machine interfaces to restore motor function in patients with paralysis.

## Available NWB Data Description

The NWB files contain extensive data from the conducted experiments, including:
- Detailed metadata about the implanted Utah arrays and their 192 channels.
- Extensive information on experimental trials, including trial IDs, go-cue times, movement onset and stop times, target positions and sizes, reaction times, and task success indicators.
- Electrode attributes such as impedance, location (x, y, z coordinates), filtering descriptions, and gain.
- Behavioral data capturing monkey's cursor, eye, and hand movement, stored under various spatial series.
- Electrophysiological data, including raw spike times across all electrodes and computed local field potentials (LFP) for the implanted arrays.
- Processed ecephys data in the form of electrical series segmented for synchronization and analysis.
- Details of the monkey subjects, including identification and session start times.
