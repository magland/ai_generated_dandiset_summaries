### Low-noise encoding of active touch by layer 4 in the somatosensory cortex

In this study, the researchers aim to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying the encoding of active touch in the mouse barrel cortex. By leveraging both intracellular and extracellular electrophysiology, they monitored the activity of neurons in layer 4 of the somatosensory cortex while the mice performed an object localization task using their whiskers. This setup allowed for tracking whisker movements and interactions with objects at millisecond precision, providing insights into how tactile information is processed and represented in the brain.

The experimental data include recordings of whisker movements, contact times, and neuronal spiking activity. Behavioral metrics such as whisker curvature, distance to pole, and lick times are also captured to understand the relationship between sensory input and motor output. This comprehensive dataset facilitates a detailed investigation into the sensory encoding properties of the somatosensory cortex and their role in facilitating active touch perception.

### Available Data in NWB Files

The NWB files contain a variety of data types relevant to the study:

- **CurrentClampSeries**: Intracellular recordings from neurons.
- **PatchClampSeries (SpikeTrain)**: Binary data indicating when spikes were detected at specific timestamps.
- **BehavioralTimeSeries**: Details on whisker movements and contacts with objects, including metrics like amplitude, phase, delta kappa (change in whisker curvature), distance to pole, and more.
- **TimeIntervals**: Data on experimental trials, including start and stop times, first lick times, pole positions, and trial responses.
