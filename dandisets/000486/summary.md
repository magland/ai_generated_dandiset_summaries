### Experiment Summary

The thermal plaid replay experiments are designed to investigate the behavioral responses of larval zebrafish, *Danio rerio*, when exposed to a virtual thermal environment. This environment is simulated through an infrared stimulus laser that replicates a thermal plaid pattern. The experiment aims to replay the navigational experience of one fish to another, thereby examining the neural and behavioral adaptations to thermal stimuli. By observing the fish in a controlled virtual reality setting, researchers can infer underlying neural mechanisms responsible for thermal perception and motility adaptation in zebrafish.

The conducted experiments employed a sophisticated laser rig for precise control of thermal conditions within the aquatic chamber. The specific study described utilized behavioral and analytical techniques to track positional changes, tail movements, and directional headings of the larval zebrafish. These data allow researchers to quantify responses such as habituation to temperature gradients and directional preferences under a patterned thermal stimulus. Key experiment variables include habituation time, gradient exposure periods, and thermal power variations, contributing to an understanding of how environmental temperature cues modulate behavior.

### NWB File Data Description

The Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files contain comprehensive data on the behavioral experiments conducted with the thermal plaid setup. Each file includes a chamber overview image at the beginning of the experiment and a plotted arena track depicting tail extraction processes. Information about the experimental setup, including specifics about the thermal environment and equipment used, is documented within the NWB files. The recorded behavioral data includes continuous tracking of cumulative tail angle, fish heading, and precise position within the chamber.

Additionally, each NWB file stores data on the power settings of the infrared laser used to create the thermal gradients, facilitating the replay condition. The data is organized with timestamps to ensure experiments can be faithfully reconstructed and analyzed. The collection of data over 36 sessions also encompasses comprehensive metadata regarding the subjects, such as their identifier, birth date, and the exact conditions of the experimental environment. This structured dataset supports both current analyses and future research endeavors aiming to deepen our understanding of sensory processing and behavioral plasticity in aquatic species.
