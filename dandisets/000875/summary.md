## Abstract

This experiment investigates the influence of increasing quantities of unipolar pulse packets on the centering of the electroporation effect within a quadrupole electrode array. Specifically, the study utilized Yo-Pro uptake to visualize the electroporative effects. The experimental setup applied varying numbers of nanosecond electric pulse packets—ranging from 4 to 40—across a four-electrode array. Results demonstrated a significant enhancement in electroporative effect with increased number of pulse packets, with a prominent peak in electroporation observed at the center of the electrode array for all tested treatments. This research was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health (NIH R21EY034258).

## Data Available in NWB Files

The dataset comprises 9 NWB files, each containing data from an experimental session where electric pulses were delivered through a quadrupole array of blunt, hollow, stainless-steel needle electrodes. The sessions involved administering packets of 15 pulses, each lasting 600 nanoseconds at a voltage of 3.2 kV. The pulses were alternated between the electrodes in a specific sequence and cycled through 10 times. The imaging data was collected using an IX83 microscope, MS-2000 scanning stage, X-Cite 110LED illuminator, and ORCA-Flash4 sCMOS camera, with CellSens software for automation. Each session captured 144 images in a 12x12 grid from a six-well plate, which were then stitched together to form a composite image. The data also includes detailed metadata on the experimental conditions and subject information.
