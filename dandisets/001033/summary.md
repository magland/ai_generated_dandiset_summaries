## Characterization of Neuron Action Potential Triggering Using Sine Wave Electrostimulation at Varying Frequencies

### Abstract

This experimental study aimed to characterize the initiation of action potentials (APs) in neurons using sine waves and modulated sine waves at varying frequencies. The experiments utilized hippocampal neurons from E18 Sprague Dawley rats, equipped with the voltage-sensitive dye FluoVolt to optically report changes in transmembrane potential. Sine waves and their modulated counterparts served as the stimulatory inputs, applied through precisely positioned tungsten electrodes controlled by a robotic micromanipulator. The intensity, frequency, and duration of the applied electrical stimuli were calibrated and monitored using a combination of waveform generators and oscilloscopes, with exposure synchronized to fluorescence imaging to capture time-resolved action potentials.

Hippocampal neurons were chosen as they offer a well-characterized model for exploring the dynamics of neuronal excitability. The study used fluorescence microscopy and high-speed imaging (3,086.4 frames/s) to record the neuron's response to electrical stimulation. The time-lapse image stacks captured rapid changes in membrane potential, enabling a detailed analysis of action potential triggering. This comprehensive data collection approach offers valuable insights into the effects of varying electrical stimuli on neuron activation, potentially informing the development of more precise neuromodulation techniques for medical applications.

### Data Available in NWB Files

The available NWB files predominantly include high-resolution time-lapse imaging data of neurons subjected to sine wave electrical stimulation. Each file contains groups for acquisition, specifically highlighting the use of fluorescence microscopy with FluoVolt dye to track transmembrane potential changes. The data sets include extensive metadata on the experimental setup, including the specific waveform parameters (e.g., frequency, amplitude) and synchronization protocols. Additionally, each NWB file documents the subject details, session descriptions, and exposure conditions, ensuring comprehensive contextual information for subsequent data analysis.
