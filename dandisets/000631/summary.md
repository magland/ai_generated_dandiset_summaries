# Experiment Summary

In this study, the researchers investigated the impact of varying the electric field vector on electroporation efficiency using paired-pulse trains and single-pulse trains. The experiments were conducted using a BPAE cell monolayer to assess changes in electroporation efficiency by analyzing YoPro-1 emission. Paired-pulse trains comprised of 5 pulses at 600 + 600 ns, while single-pulse trains consisted of 5 pulses at 600 ns. These pulse trains were applied at frequencies of 1 Hz or 833 kHz to identify alterations in the electroporation process. The experiment aimed to evaluate how the angle at which the electric field vector direction alternated between two pulses within a pair influenced electroporation. The findings indicated that paired-pulse introduction increased electroporation efficiency at smaller angles but inhibited it at larger angles, showing a frequency-dependent relationship. 

The experimental process involved capturing images that reveal the nuanced effects of electric field vector modifications on electroporation efficiency. This was achieved using an IX83 microscope with a scanning stage, superior illuminator, and high-resolution camera. The comprehensive imaging allowed for detailed visualization of the changes in the cell membrane during the electroporation process. The study was supported by the NIH grant 1R21EY034258, conducted by a team of researchers from the Pakhomov Lab at Old Dominion University.

# Data Description in NWB Files

The Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files primarily contain imaging data related to the experiment. The 15 NWB files include imaging datasets acquired using an IX83 microscope, with a MS-2000 scanning stage, and an ORCA-Flash4 sCMOS camera. The imaging channels used were ex/em 350/460nm for MemBrite dye and ex/em 480/535nm for YoPro-1, capturing electrode footprints with dark circles. A total of 144 images were taken in a 12x12 grid format from a six-well plate, plus an additional 216 images using DAPI and FITC filter cubes. These images were automatically stitched together for high-resolution composite imaging using a 10Ã—, 0.38 NA objective. Additionally, the NWB files include metadata such as experimenter details, session descriptions, timestamps, and subject information, all essential for identifying and replicating the experiment.
