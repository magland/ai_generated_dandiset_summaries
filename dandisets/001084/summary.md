# Targeted micro-fiber arrays for measuring and manipulating localized multi-scale neural dynamics over large, deep brain volumes during behavior

## Scientific Abstract

Neural population dynamics that are relevant to behavior vary across multiple spatial and temporal scales within three-dimensional brain volumes. Traditional optical methods lack the spatial coverage and resolution needed to study these patterns in large, deep brain regions like the striatum. This study presents a novel micro-fiber array technique that allows chronic measurements and optogenetic manipulations of localized neural dynamics at over 100 targeted locations simultaneously in freely moving and head-fixed mice. This method facilitates the exploration of cell-type- and neurotransmitter-specific activities in arbitrary 3D volumes with unprecedented spatial resolution and coverage.

By applying this advanced array system, the researchers were able to resolve rapid dopamine release dynamics throughout the striatum, unveiling distinct spatiotemporal patterns in response to specific sensory stimuli. The targeted optogenetics allowed for flexible, spatially precise control of neural signaling, aligning with natural signaling patterns and thereby enabling a refined understanding of the spatial localization of behavioral functions across extensive neural circuits.

## Data Available in NWB Files

The NWB files contain extensive raw and processed data from the experiments. The data includes:
- **Raw fluorescence traces** captured via multi-fiber arrays implanted in the striatum.
- **Fiber bundle imaging** data using HCImage Live microscopy with details on imaging plane and device specifications.
- **Behavioral data**, including velocity and angular velocity from mixed optical mouse sensors and time intervals of stimulus presentations (visual or auditory) and water rewards.
- **Processed imaging and photometry data**, including baseline fluorescence traces, DF/F corrected traces, and segmented ROIs from fiber photometry experiments.
- **Metadata** about fiber placements, coordinates, and specifics of the optical components (e.g., filters, light sources, detectors).
- **Videos** recorded during some sessions for additional behavioral context.
