Below is an auto-generated summary of the contents of a Dandiset. It includes both metadata and a summary of the contents of the NWB files.

Please summarize the experiment in two or three paragraphs in the style of a scientific abstract touching on the likely purpose of the experiment.

Then give a description of what data are available in the NWB files.

Finally provide a list of up to ten keywords.

You should not refer to "Type X" since these are just internal labels used for communicating the breakdown of NWB files.

The summaries are from representative NWB files for each type, so keep that in mind when making your description. So for example, the timestamp or session ID is not going to be representative of all NWB files of that type.

Please provide your response in raw markdown suitable for copy/paste into a .md document.

description: Neural population dynamics relevant to behavior vary over multiple spatial and temporal scales across three-dimensional volumes. Current optical approaches lack the spatial coverage and resolution necessary to measure and manipulate naturally occurring patterns of large-scale, distributed dynamics within and across deep brain regions such as the striatum. We designed a new micro-fiber array approach capable of chronically measuring and optogenetically manipulating local dynamics across over 100 targeted locations simultaneously in head-fixed and freely moving mice, enabling the investigation of cell-type- and neurotransmitter-specific signals over arbitrary 3D volumes at a spatial resolution and coverage previously inaccessible. We applied this method to resolve rapid dopamine release dynamics across the striatum, revealing distinct, modality-specific spatiotemporal patterns in response to salient sensory stimuli extending over millimeters of tissue.

Each array contained between 30 and 103 fibers separated by a minimum of 220Î¼m radially and 250Î¼m axially. Separation was calculated to achieve maximal coverage of the striatum volume with no overlap in the collection fields of individual fibers. Fibers were cut with a fiber scribe, and the distal ends were inspected to ensure a uniform cut, and re-cut as necessary. Distal ends were then glued inside an 1cm ca. section of polyimide tube (0.8-1.3mm diameter, MicroLumen) then cut with a fresh razorblade. The bundled fibers inside the tube were then polished on fine grained polishing paper (ThorLabs,polished first with 6 Î¼m, followed by 3 Î¼m) to create a smooth, uniform fiber bundle surface for imaging.

  pharmacology: Mice were anesthetized under isoflurane (1-3%) and placed in a stereotaxic frame.
  A large craniotomy was performed with a surgical drill (Midwest Tradition 790044, Avtec Dental RMWT) to expose the
  cortical surface above the striatum. Mice were injected with AAVs to express genetically encoded proteins for
  optical measurements and manipulations. Virus (~200-800nL per site) was injected stereotaxically through a
  pulled glass pipette (diameter 30-50Âµm) at a rate of ~100nL/min. For striatum expression, virus was injected at
  10-40 total locations chosen to maximize overlap with fiber positions. For midbrain targeting, for one set of mice,
  we injected the 4 sites relative to bregma: AP = -3.05, ML = 0.6, DV = -4.6 and DV = -4.25; AP = -3.5, ML = 1.25,
  DV = -3.9 and DV = -4.5. For a midbrain targeting in another set of mice, we injected at 3.07mm caudal to the bregma
  at 4 sites: ML = 0.5mm, DV =-4.00 mm and -4.25 mm, ML = 1mm, DV = -4.125mm and ML = 1.5 mm, DV = -3.8 mm below the dura.

  experiment_description: Neural population dynamics relevant to behavior vary over multiple spatial and temporal scales across
  three-dimensional volumes. Current optical approaches lack the spatial coverage and resolution necessary to measure
  and manipulate naturally occurring patterns of large-scale, distributed dynamics within and across deep brain
  regions such as the striatum. We designed a new micro-fiber array approach capable of chronically measuring and
  optogenetically manipulating local dynamics across over 100 targeted locations simultaneously in head-fixed and
  freely moving mice, enabling the investigation of cell-type- and neurotransmitter-specific signals over arbitrary
  3D volumes at a spatial resolution and coverage previously inaccessible. We applied this method to resolve rapid
  dopamine release dynamics across the striatum, revealing distinct, modality-specific spatiotemporal patterns in
  response to salient sensory stimuli extending over millimeters of tissue. Targeted optogenetics enabled flexible
  control of neural signaling on multiple spatial scales, better matching endogenous signaling patterns, and the
  spatial localization of behavioral function across large circuits.

  pharmacology: Mice were anesthetized under isoflurane (1-3%) and placed in a stereotaxic frame.
  A large craniotomy was performed with a surgical drill (Midwest Tradition 790044, Avtec Dental RMWT) to expose the
  cortical surface above the striatum. Mice were injected with AAVs to express genetically encoded proteins for
  optical measurements and manipulations. Virus (~200-800nL per site) was injected stereotaxically through a
  pulled glass pipette (diameter 30-50Âµm) at a rate of ~100nL/min. For striatum expression, virus was injected at
  10-40 total locations chosen to maximize overlap with fiber positions. For midbrain targeting, for one set of mice,
  we injected the 4 sites relative to bregma: AP = -3.05, ML = 0.6, DV = -4.6 and DV = -4.25; AP = -3.5, ML = 1.25,

Each array contained between 30 and 103 fibers separated by a minimum of 220Î¼m radially and 250Î¼m axially. Separation was calculated to achieve maximal coverage of the striatum volume with no overlap in the collection fields of individual fibers. Fibers were cut with a fiber scribe, and the distal ends were inspected to ensure a uniform cut, and re-cut as necessary. Distal ends were then glued inside an 1cm ca. section of polyimide tube (0.8-1.3mm diameter, MicroLumen) then cut with a fresh razorblade. The bundled fibers inside the tube were then polished on fine grained polishing paper (ThorLabs,polished first with 6 Î¼m, followed by 3 Î¼m) to create a smooth, uniform fiber bundle surface for imaging.

  pharmacology: Mice were anesthetized under isoflurane (1-3%) and placed in a stereotaxic frame.
  A large craniotomy was performed with a surgical drill (Midwest Tradition 790044, Avtec Dental RMWT) to expose the
  cortical surface above the striatum. Mice were injected with AAVs to express genetically encoded proteins for
  optical measurements and manipulations. Virus (~200-800nL per site) was injected stereotaxically through a
  pulled glass pipette (diameter 30-50Âµm) at a rate of ~100nL/min. For striatum expression, virus was injected at
  10-40 total locations chosen to maximize overlap with fiber positions. For midbrain targeting, for one set of mice,
  we injected the 4 sites relative to bregma: AP = -3.05, ML = 0.6, DV = -4.6 and DV = -4.25; AP = -3.5, ML = 1.25,
  DV = -3.9 and DV = -4.5. For a midbrain targeting in another set of mice, we injected at 3.07mm caudal to the bregma
  at 4 sites: ML = 0.5mm, DV =-4.00 mm and -4.25 mm, ML = 1mm, DV = -4.125mm and ML = 1.5 mm, DV = -3.8 mm below the dura.

  Group /general/devices/FiberArray (OpticalFiber) The optical fiber used in a multi-fiber arrays configuration, fabricated in-house to enable large scale measurements across deep brain volumes. Bare fibers were cut into pieces (ca. 3cm) then mounted under a microscope into 55-60Î¼m diameter holes in a custom 3D printed grid (3mm W x 5mm L, Boston Micro Fabrication), measured under a dissection microscope to target a particular depth beneath the grid, and secured in place with UV glue (Norland Optical Adhesive 61). Each array contained between 30 and 103 fibers separated by a minimum of 220Î¼m radially and 250Î¼m axially. Separation was calculated to achieve maximal coverage of the striatum volume with no overlap in the collection fields of individual fibers. Fibers were cut with a fiber scribe, and the distal ends were inspected to ensure a uniform cut, and re-cut as necessary. Distal ends were then glued inside an 1cm ca. section of polyimide tube (0.8-1.3mm diameter, MicroLumen) then cut with a fresh razorblade. The bundled fibers inside the tube were then polished on fine grained polishing paper (ThorLabs,polished first with 6 Î¼m, followed by 3 Î¼m) to create a smooth, uniform fiber bundle surface for imaging. A larger diameter post was mounted on one side of the plastic grid to facilitate holding during implantation.

  Group /general/devices/dLight1.3b (Indicator) green dopamine sensor
  experiment_description: Neural population dynamics relevant to behavior vary over multiple spatial and temporal scales across
  three-dimensional volumes. Current optical approaches lack the spatial coverage and resolution necessary to measure
  and manipulate naturally occurring patterns of large-scale, distributed dynamics within and across deep brain
  regions such as the striatum. We designed a new micro-fiber array approach capable of chronically measuring and
  optogenetically manipulating local dynamics across over 100 targeted locations simultaneously in head-fixed and
  freely moving mice, enabling the investigation of cell-type- and neurotransmitter-specific signals over arbitrary
  3D volumes at a spatial resolution and coverage previously inaccessible. We applied this method to resolve rapid
  dopamine release dynamics across the striatum, revealing distinct, modality-specific spatiotemporal patterns in
  response to salient sensory stimuli extending over millimeters of tissue. Targeted optogenetics enabled flexible
  control of neural signaling on multiple spatial scales, better matching endogenous signaling patterns, and the
  spatial localization of behavioral function across large circuits.
