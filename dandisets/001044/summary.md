# Experiment Summary

This dataset encompasses a long-term study of brain electrophysiology in 15 temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) rats treated with pilocarpine. The primary goal of the experiment was to investigate the development of epilepsy in these animals by capturing multi-site local field potential (LFP) signals from 12 specific sites within the Papez circuit. This analysis includes observing spontaneous seizures and interictal events during the chronic phase of epilepsy development. By detailing these brain activities, the dataset aims to shed light on the alterations in seizure onset zone (SOZ), seizure onset patterns (SOP), and functional network connectivity throughout the progression of epilepsy from early to late stages.

Technological validation of the dataset was conducted using histology and signal-specific analysis techniques, ensuring the reliability of the recorded data. MATLAB scripts are included to facilitate basic analyses, such as power spectral analysis, the identification of seizure onset patterns, and the detection of interictal spikes. This comprehensive dataset serves to advance our understanding of the brain's electrophysiological and epileptic network properties in chronic TLE, offering critical insights that can inform the design of adaptive neuromodulation therapies for epilepsy.

# Available Data in NWB Files

The NWB files contain extensive electrophysiological data recorded from depth electrodes implanted in various regions of the temporal lobe and surrounding areas. Specific datasets include raw LFP signals acquired during both non-ictal and ictal periods across different time points, categorized as early and late stages of epilepsy development. Each file meticulously documents the electrode information, such as the group and location, and includes dynamic tables that link electrodes to recorded electrical series data. The NWB files also contain metadata about the devices used, session descriptions, timestamps, and subject identifiers.
