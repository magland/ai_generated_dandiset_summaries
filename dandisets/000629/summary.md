# Experimental Summary

In the dataset titled "Neurofeedback training can modulate task-relevant memory replay rate in rats" by Gillespie et al. (2024), the research aimed to investigate how neurofeedback training influences memory replay processes in rats during task engagement. The study employed an eight-arm flexible spatial task where four neurofeedback trained rats experienced modulation of their memory replay rate, which is critical for spatial learning and memory consolidation. The electrophysiological and behavioral data obtained from these experiments support the hypothesis that neurofeedback can effectively modulate the rate of memory replay, potentially improving cognitive performance. Control cohort data for comparison can be found in a separate Dandiset.

The electrophysiological recordings were made using dorsal CA1 tetrodes, capturing multi-electrode extracellular signals. The study meticulously tracked behavioral events such as port triggers, reward delivery, and positional data, integrating these with the electrophysiological recordings to offer a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between neurofeedback and memory processes. The results contribute to the growing field of neurofeedback as a tool for cognitive enhancement and provide critical insights into the neural mechanisms underlying memory replay.

# NWB Files Data Description

The 68 NWB files in this dataset provide a detailed account of the experiment. Key data elements include Voltage recordings from tetraodes across various sessions, each session involving multiple electrode groups and associated behavioral states. Metadata about the general setup includes details about the devices used (cameras, data acquisition systems), the experimental paradigm description, and specifics of the probe configurations.

The files contain comprehensive data on extracellular electrophysiological signals, behavioral events (such as beam crossings and light triggers), and spatial information (position tracking across the arms of the maze). Additional information includes timestamps, experimental epochs, and sample counts for correlating neural data with behavior. Also included are logs from the statescript used during the experiments, which detail trial events and task conditions.
