## Abstract

The study titled "Individualized Target Selection of Closed-loop Electrical Stimulation for the Treatment of Spontaneous Temporal Lobe Epilepsy" explores the efficacy of personalized electrical stimulation targets in managing temporal lobe epilepsy. Conducted on seven pilocarpine-treated rats, the research involved continuous four-channel electrophysiological recordings over a period ranging from 5 to 10 days per subject. Each rat experienced two phases characterized by baseline observation and active stimulation, with the aim of recording at least six spontaneous seizures per group. The randomized assignment of stimulation targets across groups allowed an independent examination of therapeutic efficacy, thus contributing to the understanding of individualized treatment plans for epilepsy management.

This dataset, archived in the NWB format and available on the DANDI Archive, offers an in-depth exploration of brain network dynamics resulting from directed electrical stimulation during epileptic seizures. The inclusion of both baseline and stimulation phases enables a comparative analysis of neural activity, emphasizing variations in response by individuals to targeted therapeutic interventions. Through this dataset, researchers can delve into the nuances of closed-loop stimulation approaches and their effects on spontaneous seizure modulation.

## Data Description

The NWB files encompass extensive electrophysiological data documenting spontaneous seizure activity within temporal lobe epilepsy models. Each file includes raw acquisition data recorded across multiple sessions, with electrode activity captured at various temporal stages of seizures. Key data groups organize electrical series based on specific acquisition criteria like baseline or stimulation stages, providing detailed timestamps and electrodes information.

The NWB files also detail the electrode configuration, linking them to specific brain regions such as R_ANT, R_CA1, R_CA3, and R_DG, thereby categorizing the data by both the anatomical positions and procedural stages. Additionally, metadata concerning session descriptions, subject identifiers, and institutional affiliations (Zhejiang University) are richly documented, enhancing the dataset's usability for downstream analyses in neurophysiological research.
