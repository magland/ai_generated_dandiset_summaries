## Maintenance of persistent activity in a frontal thalamocortical loop

### Abstract
This study aimed to investigate the dynamics of persistent activity within the anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) and thalamus during a tactile discrimination task that required a delayed directional response. Specifically, spikes were recorded from these brain regions as mice performed the task. Similar to ALM neurons, thalamic neurons exhibited selective persistent delay activity predictive of movement direction. Unilateral photoinhibition of delay activity in the ALM or thalamus led to contralesional neglect. In particular, photoinhibition of the thalamus caused a rapid and near-total collapse of ALM activity, while photoinhibition of the ALM similarly reduced thalamic activity. These findings highlight the role of the thalamus as a crucial circuit hub in motor preparation, suggesting that reciprocal excitation across these brain areas is essential for maintaining persistent activity.

### Data Description
The Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files contain a comprehensive set of data from the experimentation, including recordings of spikes from extracellular electrodes, metadata about electrode configurations and filtering, and trial intervals. Data include information on electrode impedance, coordinates, and location within the subject's brain. Additionally, behavioral and optogenetic experiments are well-documented, with detailed metadata on stimulus coordinates, types, and power, as well as response times. Furthermore, the files contain units of spike times for each recorded neuron, their coordinates, and specific cell types, accompanied by mean waveform and standard deviation of spike waveform.
