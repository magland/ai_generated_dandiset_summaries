### Abstract

The Thermal Plaid Experiments investigate the navigational behaviors of larval zebrafish within a controlled virtual thermal environment. The experiment employs an infrared stimulus laser to create a thermal plaid pattern, testing the zebrafish's ability to navigate thermal gradients. By monitoring the fish's responses to these stimuli, researchers aim to better understand the neural and behavioral strategies employed during thermal navigation. The study is organized under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health and conducted by Martin Haesemeyer at THE Ohio State University, highlighting its significance in understanding organismal responses to thermal environments.

The experimental setup involves placing larval zebrafish in a water-filled chamber with a temperature-controlled environment. The fish are subjected to sequences of habituation, pre-gradient exposure, and thermal plaid stimulus, with parameters defining temperature peaks, troughs, and patterns. These experimental conditions allow for precise measurement of zebrafish behaviors in response to thermal stimuli, contributing to understanding sensory processing and behavioral adaptation.

### Data Summary

The NWB files encapsulate a comprehensive set of data documenting the behavior and responses of larval zebrafish subjected to thermal stimuli. Key data includes high-resolution chamber overview images, detailing the fish's environment at the experiment's start. The acquisition module captures the arena track during tail extraction, with notable metadata such as experiment configurations, timestamped events, and physical parameters of the setup. 

Behavioral data is processed to reveal fish positioning within the swim lane, cumulative tail angle, and heading direction over time, recorded at a frame rate of 250 Hz and a resolution of 8 px/mm. Detailed experimental variables are logged in the processing module, offering insights into the ongoing conditions experienced by the zebrafish. Additionally, the stimulus module tracks the infrared laser power, key to creating thermal gradients that provoke navigational responses from the fish.
