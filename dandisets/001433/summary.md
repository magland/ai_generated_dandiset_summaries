## Abstract

This experiment investigates the relationship between breathing rhythms and neural activity within the olfactory bulb of freely-behaving mice. Conducted by the Smear lab at the University of Oregon, this study utilized simultaneous recordings of local field potentials (LFP) and sniffing behavior to explore olfactory processing in the absence of discrete stimuli, tasks, or rewards. The study's central aim is to better understand how naturally occurring olfactory neural dynamics are modulated by respiratory patterns, potentially elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying olfaction in unstructured environments.

Electrophysiological signals were recorded using the OpenEphys system from mice not engaged in any particular behaviors, thus offering a baseline profile of the intrinsic neural activity in the olfactory bulb. The recordings focused on documenting LFPs and nasal airflow, the latter measured through a sniff thermistor for assessing sniffing rhythms. This data could provide insights into the coupling between olfactory neural circuits and respiratory activity, exploring hypotheses related to sensory processing and behavioral states.

## NWB File Data Description

The NWB files contain comprehensive electrophysiological data, particularly focusing on local field potential (LFP) signals recorded from the olfactory bulb region via an array of electrodes. Each file includes a detailed metadata section capturing electrode information such as filtering and placement within the brain. The files also track behavioral data through the acquisition of sniffing signals, measured as raw sniff thermistor voltage readings. Processing modules within the files analyze inhalation and exhalation times, offering a temporal framework for interpreting neural and behavioral dynamics.
