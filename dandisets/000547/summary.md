## Perivascular Pumping of Cerebrospinal Fluid in the Brain with a Valve Mechanism

### Abstract
This study investigates the dynamics of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) movement in the brain, specifically through the penetrating arteries of mice, utilizing a valve mechanism. The primary aim is to understand how CSF is pumped perivascularly and the role that functional hyperemia plays in this process. Two-photon microscopy was employed to image the penetrating arteries originating from the middle cerebral artery (MCA) at varying depths (0 and 100 Âµm). Whisker stimulation via air puffs was used to induce functional hyperemia, enabling the observation of neurovascular coupling and its impact on CSF movement.

The imaging sessions were conducted to record the CSF dynamics during induced hyperemia. The data gathered provides insights into the interactions between neuronal activity, blood flow, and CSF movement, which could inform future studies on brain homeostasis and related neurological diseases. Overall, the research highlights the significance of vascular response in regulating CSF flow in the brain.

### Data Description
The dataset comprises 70 NWB files containing two-photon microscopy recordings from 9 mice. The files are categorized based on imaging sessions, where each file includes data on the optical channels, imaging planes, and device settings (Bergamo II). Specific sessions include 90-second recordings with whisker stimulation occurring between 30 to 60 seconds. The files also contain metadata pertaining to the experimental setup, including subject identifiers and timestamps. The dataset covers various variables measured such as the TwoPhotonSeries, ImagingPlane, OpticalChannel, and ProcessingModule.
