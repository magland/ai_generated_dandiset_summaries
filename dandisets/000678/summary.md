# Mouse Auditory and Visual Discrimination Experiment

In this study, we investigated the neural and behavioral dynamics underlying sensory discrimination in head-fixed mice. Subjects were trained to classify auditory and visual stimuli using a two-alternative choice paradigm. The mice were presented with either a frequency of auditory tone cloud stimuli or an angle of a drifting Gabor patch, and they were required to respond by licking the appropriate left or right port to receive a reward. The primary objective was to examine how sensory discrimination is influenced by pupil dynamics, locomotion, and face motion energy during task performance.

We collected data from 391 behavioral sessions involving 13 subjects. Several metrics were recorded, including pupil diameter, face motion energy, and locomotion speed. The data were analyzed to understand the relationship between sensory perception and motor behavior, providing insights into the neural mechanisms of sensory discrimination. Detailed analysis of these experimental parameters enabled us to examine the trial-by-trial variability in sensory decision-making and its associated behavioral responses.

## Available Data in the NWB Files

The NWB files include comprehensive data covering various aspects of the experiment:
- **Face Energy**: Pixel intensity time differential within the face region of interest (ROI).
- **Left and Right Licks**: Timing of licks at the left and right ports.
- **Pupil Diameter and Area**: Length of the long axis and the area of the pupil, calculated both online during the sessions and post-hoc.
- **Rewards**: Timing of rewards delivered at the left and right ports.
- **Running Speed**: Estimated speed from a rotary encoder attached to the running wheel.
- **Whisker Energy**: Pixel intensity time differential within the whisker pad ROI.

Additionally, detailed trial information is provided, including auditory and visual stimulus parameters, trial choices, cue characteristics, trial outcomes, and stimulus presentation times.
