# Multimodal Human Brain Imaging Data

## Abstract

This dataset builds upon Dandiset 26 by providing extensive multimodal human brain imaging data. The primary objective of this experiment is likely to advance the understanding of complex neural processes by integrating various imaging techniques. The data were meticulously collected to ensure comprehensive brain activity representation, facilitating diverse analyses ranging from basic neuroscience research to applied clinical studies.

Multiple imaging modalities were employed to capture complementary aspects of brain function and structure. This multimodal approach enhances the robustness of the dataset and provides a richer resource for the research community. The dataset includes intricate details on neural activity and connectivity, which can be leveraged to investigate a broad range of neuroscientific questions.

## Available Data

The NWB files associated with this Dandiset contain a wealth of information derived from human brain imaging studies. Given the nature of NWB files, they likely include electrophysiological recordings, imaging data, and metadata describing the experimental conditions. These files offer detailed insights into neural dynamics, spatially and temporally resolved, suitable for various kinds of advanced analyses.
