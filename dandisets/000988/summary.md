### Experiment Summary

The study titled "Photophysics-informed two-photon voltage imaging using FRET-opsin voltage indicators" explores the use of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) in conjunction with optical systems to record voltage changes. Conducted at Harvard University under the guidance of the Adam Cohen Lab, this research uses various novel dyes and voltage indicators, such as Voltron1 and Voltron2, in a combination of HEK cells, ex vivo mouse brain slices, and in vivo anesthetized mouse barrel cortex. The primary aim is to optimize imaging techniques that leverage two-photon excitation for high-resolution voltage imaging to understand the voltage dynamics at the cellular and subcellular levels.

The dataset is composed of multiple experimental paradigms, including one-photon photophysical exploration and two-photon voltage-sensitive recordings. These experiments are instrumental in elucidating the photophysical characteristics that influence voltage sensitivity and response. Through meticulous manipulation of optical pathways and recording conditions, the dataset aims to refine the functional implementation of these voltage indicators and improve the accuracy and reliability of voltage imaging.

### Available Data in NWB Files

The NWB files in this dataset comprise detailed metadata and experimental recordings. The files are categorized into five distinct types, each with specific recording setups and purposes:

1. **Type 1 NWB Files**: These files primarily capture voltage step experiments from HEK cells using one-photon systems. They include time series data from various acquisition channels, including analog inputs and outputs related to patch clamp data.
  
2. **Type 2 NWB Files**: These files document two-photon voltage step experiments, encompassing image series from confocal systems and time series data from acquisition channels tracking different optical and electrophysiological parameters.
  
3. **Type 3 NWB Files**: Focused on finding the inversion point during two-photon imaging, these files contain detailed recordings similar to type 2 but emphasize voltage inversion experiments.
  
4. **Type 4 NWB Files**: These files offer data from two-photon voltage step experiments with additional control over different laser and shutter channels, providing enhanced insights into the dye behavior under varied excitation conditions.
  
5. **Type 5 NWB Files**: Similar to type 3, these files also focus on voltage inversion experiments but with Voltron1JF608 indicator, documenting analogous acquisition channels and experimental setups.
