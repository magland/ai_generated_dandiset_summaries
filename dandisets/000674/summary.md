## Abstract 

The study involves volumetric multiplex imaging of whole brains from humans, macaques, and marmosets, processed using the SHIELD technique. 4 mm coronal sections of the brains were stained with DNA-labeled antibodies and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) probes to enable detailed cellular and molecular characterization. These stained sections were then imaged using oblique fluorescence light sheet microscopes, providing high-resolution volumetric data. The purpose of this experiment is likely to map the spatial distribution of various cellular components and gene expressions across different species, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of brain structure and function in both humans and non-human primates.

The use of SHIELD processing, which preserves the structural and molecular integrity of brain tissues, in combination with multiplex staining and advanced imaging techniques, allows for comprehensive three-dimensional mapping of brain architecture. By comparing the molecular and cellular compositions across species, this study aims to identify conserved and unique features of primate brains, which could potentially offer insights into human brain evolution, functionality, and associated disorders.

## Data Description

The dataset includes volumetric imaging data acquired from 4 mm coronal sections of human, macaque, and marmoset brains. Each section was multi-round stained with DNA-labeled antibodies and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) probes. The images were captured using oblique fluorescence light sheet microscopes, which provide high-resolution, three-dimensional views of the stained brain sections. The total dataset amounts to approximately 4.62 GB in size, comprising 9 files and covering 9 samples from a single subject.
