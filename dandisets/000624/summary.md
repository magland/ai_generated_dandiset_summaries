# A Brainstem Circuit for the Expression of Defensive Facial Reactions in Rat

Chemoreceptors in the nasal epithelium can trigger an apneic reaction and a grimace in response to airborne irritants. This study, conducted by Callado Pérez et al., investigates the underlying neural circuitry responsible for these defensive reactions. Unlike previous assumptions linking these responses to olfaction, the research identifies a crucial role of neurons in the muralis subnucleus of the spinal trigeminal complex. Activation of these neurons inhibits the Pre-Bötzinger inhalation oscillator, thereby delineating a pathway that functions independently of olfactory processes.

The experiment utilized both behavioral and electrophysiological methodologies on Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus). Subjects were exposed to ammonia stimulation to evoke facial grimaces and apneic reactions under various conditions. Data was collected including spike train recordings from neurons in the muralis subnucleus and behavioral responses such as lever presses indicative of defensive reactions. These interdisciplinary approaches aim to elucidate the precise role of brainstem circuits in mediating defensive behaviors.

## Data Available in NWB Files

The dataset comprises 27 NWB files, divided into two primary types. Type 1 NWB files contain data on the neural responses to ammonia stimulation in anesthetized rats. This includes detailed timestamps, trial data, behavioral events (e.g., lever presses), and spike times recorded from neurons. Specific metadata for these files mentions Rat10 as the subject with sessions starting on December 15, 2022.

Type 2 NWB files include data on facial grimace responses in head-fixed rats. These files document the use of stimuli such as NH3 or an air puff, captured using an A602f camera. Metadata from these files records a subject identified as Rat332 and details sessions that began on September 22, 2022. The focus is on the grimace response to stimuli, providing insights into behavioral expressions associated with adverse sensory inputs.
