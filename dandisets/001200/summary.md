## Abstract

The study investigates the effects of dual stimulation modalities on neural pathways in Norway rats, specifically focusing on optogenetic and transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) stimulation. Using a genetically modified approach, the research differentiated between excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons in the somatosensory cortex and the posteromedial complex of the thalamus. Optogenetic tagging was achieved via adeno-associated virus (AAV) injections targeting CaMKII or PV. Stimulation protocols involved varying pulse repetition frequencies, pulse durations, and pressure levels during ultrasound application. This was carried out using a 128-element random array ultrasound transducer, establishing a systematic approach to observe the reactions of the neuronal subtypes across 500 trials per session, with ultrasound stimuli administrated every 2.5 seconds with a 10% jitter.

Electrophysiological data were collected through NeuroNexus electrodes implanted in both the somatosensory cortex and thalamus regions, employing either 32-channel or 64-channel configurations. This set-up allowed for detailed recording and analysis of neural spikes, aiming to understand the dynamic interactions and response patterns incited by multimodal stimulation. The study contributes to a broader understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings and potential applications of optogenetic and tFUS technologies in modulating neuronal activity.

## NWB Files Description

The NWB files primarily include detailed recordings from the experiments, featuring attributes such as file creation dates, data collection methodologies, and device specifications. The electrodes' metadata such as location, impedance, group identity, and coordinates are thoroughly documented. Also included are optogenetic stimulus characteristics, trial intervals with precise start and end timestamps, and unit data encompassing cell type labels and spike timings. The files contain a comprehensive collection of datasets from diverse sessions facilitating an elaborate exploration of recorded neural activity in response to the applied stimulations.
