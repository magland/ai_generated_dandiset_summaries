### Abstract

This study, conducted by the Allen Institute, investigates the spatial and temporal frequency tuning in the mouse visual cortex utilizing two-photon calcium imaging. The dataset captures responses from pyramidal neurons and somatostatin inhibitory interneurons in various cortical layers (2/3, 4, 5, and 6) and visual areas (VISp, VISl, VISal, VISpm, VISam, and VISrl) to full-field drifting gratings moving in four different directions. These stimuli were presented at five spatial frequencies (0.02, 0.04, 0.08, 0.16, 0.32 cycles per degree) and five temporal frequencies (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 Hz). This experimental setup allows for the analysis of the speed tuning of visual neurons, a property that can vary across cortical areas.

The Cre lines expressing GCaMP6f used in this study are imaged across several cortical layers and visual areas, providing a comprehensive view of the functional organization of the mouse visual cortex. The experimental sessions utilize the same data collection pipeline as the Allen Brain Observatory, ensuring consistency in visual stimulus monitor calibration, positioning, and imaging systems. The use of a running wheel to track locomotion further allows for the examination of the behavior-physiology relationship in these visual responses.

### NWB File Contents

The NWB files contain extensive data on neural and behavioral responses during the visual stimulation sessions. The files include information on various general devices, imaging planes, and optical channels used during the experiments. Detailed intervals of experimental epochs, including contrast, direction, spatial frequency, and temporal frequency data, are recorded alongside start and stop times for each epoch.

The processing modules include data on optical physiology, eye behavior, fluorescence signals (raw, demixed, and Df/F traces), image segmentation, motion correction, and running behavior. Specific datasets within these modules detail the segmented cells with cell specimen IDs, image masks for each region of interest (ROI), and various time series data measuring eye and running behavior. Finally, the stimulus processing module records the stimulus times, providing a comprehensive dataset for analyzing the relationship between visual stimuli and neural responses.
